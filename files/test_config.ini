# Replication tests which do some DML (i.e. changes not only metadata but data itself) had a problem:
# it was necessary run SWEEP after test completion, both for DB_MAIN and DB_REPL. Otherwise next runs
# of this test (or other tests related to replication) caused:
#     "ERROR: Record format with length <NNN> is not found for table TEST"
# (discussed with dimitr, letters since 04-aug-2021)
# This problem existed during 2021...2022 and then was fixed:
#     * for FB 4.x: 26-jan-2023, commit 2ed48a62c60c029cd8cb2b0c914f23e1cb56580a
#     * for FB 5.x: 20-apr-2023, commit 5af209a952bd2ec3723d2c788f2defa6b740ff69
# (log message: 'Avoid random generation of field IDs, respect the user-specified order instead').
# If we want to check these two commits (making SKIP sweep) in all replication tests then set parameter
# RUN_SWEEP_AT_END to zero. Otherwise (if regression occurs and some of tests again fail with message
# related to record format) set RUN_SWEEP_AT_END to 1.
