ISSUE:       4625
TITLE:       Lookup (or scan) in descending index could be very inefficient for some keys
DESCRIPTION:
  This is ADDITIONAL test for issue in ticket: "Pavel Zotov added a comment - 23/Dec/13 04:02 PM".
  Separate fix was required for this issue, see comments in
  https://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/mailman/message/31785278/

   +Additional fix for bug CORE-4302 : Lookup (or scan) in descending index could be very inefficient...
  ===
  Excessive fetches count reproduced on WI-T3.0.0.30566 (Alpha1 release).
  Current results were checked on Windows (2.5.6.26994, 3.0.0.32484, 4.0.0.138) and POSIX (4.0.0.138)
NOTES:
[29.07.2016]
  On 4.0.0.316 number of fetches is ~99 thus new threshold was added for engine = 4.0.
[18.08.2020]
  FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
  statement 'alter sequence <seq_name> restart with 0' changes rdb$generators.rdb$initial_value to -1 thus next call
  gen_id(<seq_name>,1) will return 0 (ZERO!) rather than 1.
  See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d
  This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt

  Because of this, it was decided to replace 'alter sequence restart...' with subtraction of two gen values:
  c = gen_id(<g>, -gen_id(<g>, 0)) -- see procedure sp_restart_sequences.
