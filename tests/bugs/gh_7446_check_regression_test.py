ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7446
DESCRIPTION:
    Problem was reported privately by firebird user. As a visible result there were core dump and an error in firebird.log:
        Operating system call pthread_mutex_lock failed. Error code 22

    An error happens due to an attempt to cleanup (too late attempt - when processing disconnect in CS)
    savepoint stored in metadata cache. Put attention that savepoints are always created in transaction memory pool and keeping
    them after commit/rollback in metadata cache is bad idea.

NOTES:
    [01.02.2023] pzotov
    This test checks regression that was introduced by first attempt to solve problem described in the title.
    SQL example was provided by dimitr, see letter 31-jan-2023 13:43. Running SQL script must NOT issue any output.
    There is no similar test in old fbtest QA suite.

    Regression can be reproduced on:
        * FB 3.0.11.33654 (17-jan-2023): "SQLSTATE = 3B000 / Unable to find savepoint with name S in transaction context".
    Checked on:
        3.0.11.33658; 4.0.3.2894; 5.0.0.920 - all fine.
