# title:        ALTER USER XXX INACTIVE
# decription:   
#                   We create two users ('foo' and 'bar') and make them immediatelly INACTIVE.
#                   One of them has been granted with RDB$ADMIN role, so he will be able to manage of other user access.
#                   Then we chek then connect for one of these users (e.g., 'foo') is unable because of his inactive status.
#                   After this we change state of FOO to active and verify that he can make connect.
#                   When this user successfully establish connect, he will try to :
#                   * create and immediatelly drop new user ('rio');
#                   * change state of other existing user ('bar') to active.
#                   Finally, we check that user 'bar' really can connect now (after he was allowed to do this by 'foo').
#

#                   FB config parameters AuthClient and UserManager must contain 'Srp' plugin in their values.
