ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7269
TITLE:       Database restore must make every effort on activating deferred indexes
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses unrecoverable .fbk that was provided in the ticket and tries to restore it using '-verbose' option.
    After restore finish, we check its log. It must contain SEVERAL errors related to indices (PK and two FK),
    and also it must have messages about FINAL point of restore (regardless error that follows after this):
        gbak:finishing, closing, and going home
        gbak:adjusting the ONLINE and FORCED WRITES flags
NOTES:
    [02.11.2024] pzotov
    Checked on 5.0.2.1551, 6.0.0.415.
