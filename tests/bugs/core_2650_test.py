ISSUE:       3057
TITLE:       Improve sorting performance when long VARCHARs are involved
DESCRIPTION:
  Test verifies trivial queries with persistent and computed columns, predicates, views,
  expressions without reference to any column and datatypes which have no symmetrical
  transformation from value to a key (decfloat, time-with-timezone and varchar with non-default collation).

  It is supposed that default value of InlineSortThreshold parameter is 1000.
  No changes in the firebird.conf reuired.

  This test most probably will be added by some new examples later.

  Thanks to dimitr for lot of explanations (e-mail discussion was 28.12.2020).
