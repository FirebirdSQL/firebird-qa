ISSUE:       6649
TITLE:       FB crashes on attempt to create table with number of fields greater than 5460
DESCRIPTION:
  It was found that maximal number of fields with type = BIGINT that could fit in a table DDL is 8066.
  If this limit is exeeded then FB raises "new record size of N bytes is too big" (where N >= 65536).
  We use for-loop with two iterations, each of them does following:
    1. Create table with total number of fields = <N> (one for 'ID primary key' plus 8064 for
       'user-data' fields with names 'F1', 'F2', ..., 'F'<N>-1). All of them have type = BIGINT.
    2. DO RECONNECT // mandatory! otherwise crash can not be reproduced.
    3. Run UPDATE OR INSERT statement that is specified in the ticker(insert single record with ID=1).
    4. Run SELECT statement which calculates total sum on all 'user-data' fields.
  When N = 8065 then these actions must complete successfully and result of final SELECT must be displayed.
  When N = 8066 then we have to get exception:
    Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 54000
    unsuccessful metadata update
    -new record size of 65536 bytes is too big

  Confirmed bug on 4.0.0.2204: got crash when N=8065 (but still "new record size of 65536 bytes is too big" when N=8066).
  Checked on 3.0.7.33368, 4.0.0.2214 - all OK.

[24.03.2022] pzotov
  On WINDOWS excessive lines in STDERR (after first error) appear because ISQL ignores 'SET BAIL' command or '-bail' switch
  in case when it executing commands that come via PIPE mechanism.
  Discussed with FB-team, letter with subj "[new-qa] ISQL "SET BAIL ON" problem on Windows when commands come from PIPE", 12-mar-2022 16:04.
  It looks strange but such behaviour was considered as DESIRED feature and requested long ago (in 2011).
  This means that it is very unlikely that it will be fixed and ISQL will behave like on POSIX (where no such effect occurs).
  Because of this, it was decided to change test: we create temporary SQL file and provide this file as input script for launching ISQL,
  see:
      act.isql(..., input_file=isql_script, ...)
