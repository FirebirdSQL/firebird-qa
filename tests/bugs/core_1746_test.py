ISSUE:       2170
TITLE:       Expression index can be created while doing inserts into table
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-1746
FBTEST:      bugs.core_1746
NOTES:
    [15.01.2022] pcisar
        This test may FAIL when run on slow machine (like VM), or fast one (Windows 10 with SSD)
    [19.09.2022] pzotov
        Fully reimplemented. Issue described in the ticket can be easy reproduced WITHOUT any concurrent workload.
        We can create table with single column and two connections. First of them just inserts one record and
        second attempts to create index.
        On 2.5.3.26780 and 3.0.0.32483 statement 'create index' will pass (and this must be considered as problem).
        On 2.5.27020 and 3.0.1 such attempt leads to exception "-901 / object ... in use" - and this is expected.
        See also core_4386_test.py.

    Checked on 3.0.8.33535 (SS/CS), 4.0.1.2692 (SS/CS), 5.0.0.730 (SS/CS)
