ISSUE:       6941
TITLE:       Dummy (always true) conditions may change the join order
DESCRIPTION:
    Issue from ticket can NOT be reproduced if we restore only metadata: plans do not differ.
    Because of this, it was decided to use database that was provided by ticket author.
    We decompress it, make full restore (metadata + data) and apply test query TWISE:
    run-1: without any 'always true' part statement;
    run-2: _with_ 'always true' part statement (see loop with using 'x_true' variable).
    For each query we make only its preparing and add execution PLAN to the Python set()
    object (see 'plan_set').
    Finally, we check that length of this set is 1.
NOTES:
    [20.02.2023] pzotov
    Confirmed bug on 5.0.0.733; 4.0.3.2844; 3.0.11.33628 (length of plan_set is 2).
    Checked on: 5.0.0.957; 4.0.3.2876; 3.0.11.33664 -- all fine.
