# title:        Make it possible to start multiple transactions (possibly in different attachments) using the same initial transaction snapshot
# decription:   
#                   We open first connect using FDB and set custom transaction parameter block which is used to start SNAPSHOT transaction.
#                   Within this first transaction (tx1a) we insert into test table record with value = -2 and commit this Tx.
#                   Then we do start next transaction (also SNAPSHOT; its name = 'tx1b') and obtain value of RDB$GET_CONTEXT('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER').
#                   Also, in this second 'tx1b' we add one more record into table with value = -1 using autonomous transaction --> BOTH records should be seen 
#                   in another attachment that will be started after this moment.
#                   But if this (new) attachment will start Tx with requirement to use snapshot that was for Tx1a then it must see only FIRST record with value=-2.
#               
#                   We launch then ISQL for establish another transaction and make it perform two transactions:
#                   1) 'set transaction snapshot' --> must extract both records from test table
#                   === vs === 
#                   2) 'set transaction snapshot at number %(snap_num)s' --> must extract only FIRST record with value = -2.
#               
#                   THis is done TWO times: when based snapshot is KNOWN (i.e. tx1b is alive) and after tx1b is committed and base is unknown.
#                   Second ISQL launch must issue error:
#                       Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 0B000
#                       Transaction's base snapshot number does not exist
#               
#                   Checked on: 4.0.0.1457 (SS,CS) -- works fine.
