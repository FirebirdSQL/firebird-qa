ISSUE:       5740
TITLE:       Trace stops any writing to its log if client sends text that can not be transliterated between character sets
DESCRIPTION:
    It was detected that trace can stop any writing to its log if client issues query with character
    that can NOT transliterated between character sets. Such statement and *any* other statements
    that go after will NOT be reflected in the trace if its config contain include_filter with any
    rule (even such trivial as: include_filter = "%").

    Initial discuss: july-2019, subj:  "... fbtrace returned error on call trace_dsql_execute" (mailbox: pz@ibase.ru).
    Letter with example how to reproduce: 16.07.19 22:08.
    Finally this bug was fixed 26.03.2020:
        https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/70ed61cba88ad70bd868079016cde3b338073db8
    ::: NB :::
    Problem was found  only in FB 3.0; 4.x works OK because of new regexp mechanism in it.

    Test launches trace with include_filter option, and then runs isql with executing three statements.
    First and third statements contrain ascii-only text, second has a character which can not be transliterated from utf8
    to narrow-byte encoding (see 'CHECKED_CHARACTER' and 'CAST_TO_CHARSET' variables).
    We have to check that:
    1. isql actually shows only 1st and 3rd statement, and issues STDERR with SQLSTATE = 22018 for second statement;
    2. trace log contains all *three* statements that were executed by isql, including one that contains <CHECKED_CHARACTER>.
    
    Confirmed bug on 3.0.6.33273: only first statement appears in the trace.
    All fine on 3.0.6.33276: all three statements can be seen in the trace.

NOTES:
    [08.06.2022] pzotov
    Adapted for firebird-qa plugin. Confirmed problem on 3.0.6.33273. Checked on 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - all OK.
