ISSUE:       5482
TITLE:       Return nonzero result code when restore fails on activating and creating deferred user index
DESCRIPTION:
    According to Alex response on letter 25-apr-2016 19:15, zero retcode returned ONLY when restore
    was done WITH '-verbose' switch, and this was fixed.
    When restoring is performed without additional switches then retcode is 1.

    We create table with UNIQUE computed-by index which expression refers to other table (Firebird allows this!).
    Because other table (test_2) initially is empty, index _can_ be created. But after this we insert record into
    this table and do commit. Since that moment backup of this database will have table test_1 but its index will
    NOT be able to restore (unless '-i' switch specified).
    We will use this inability of restore index by checking 'gbak -rep -v ...' return code: it should be NON zero.
    If code will skip exception then this will mean FAIL of test.
JIRA:        CORE-5201
FBTEST:      bugs.core_5201
NOTES:
    [07.02.2023] pzotov
    Adjusted tail of restore log: added messages
        gbak: ERROR:Database is not online due to failure to activate one or more indices.
        gbak: ERROR:    Run gfix -online to bring database online without active indices.
   (actual since 5.0.0.932; will be soon also for FB 3.x and 4.x - see letter from Alex, 07.02.2023 11:53).
