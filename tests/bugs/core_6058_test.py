# title:        Change behavior of skipped and repeated wall times within time zones
# decription:   
#                   Confirmed wrong output on 4.0.0.1421. Works OK on 4.0.0.1524
#               
#                   27.10.2020.
#                   Parser changed after following fixes:
#                       - CORE-6427 - Whitespace as date separator causes conversion error.
#                       - CORE-6429 - Timezone offset in timestamp/time literal and CAST should follow SQL standard syntax only.
#                   See: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/ff37d445ce844f991242b1e2c1f96b80a5d1636d
#                   Adjusted expected stdout/stderr after discuss with Adriano.
#                   Checked on 4.0.0.2238
#                
# tracker_id:   CORE-6058
# min_versions: ['4.0']
# versions:     4.0
