ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7168
TITLE:       Ignore missing UDR libraries during restore
DESCRIPTION:
    Database with 3d-party UDR was created beforehand in FB 4.0.1, backed up and .fbk was compressed.
    After decompressing .fbk we try to restore this database using FB snapshot which for sure has no
    such UDR, with verbose = True.
    Test verifies that restore log contains messages about UDR and correct finish of restoring process.
NOTES:
    [02.03.2023] pzotov
    Confirmed problem on 4.0.1.2707 (21-jan-2022), 5.0.0.471 (09-apr-2022): restore fails with error
    "firebird.driver.types.DatabaseError: UDR module not loaded" and message after it that can be in localized.
    Checked on: 4.0.3.2904, 5.0.0.475 -- all OK.
