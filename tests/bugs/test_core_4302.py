# title:         Lookup (or scan) in descending index could be very inefficient for some keys
# decription:   
#                  ### NB, 16-apr-2016  ###
#                  1. Bug of this ticket was introduced _after_ FB 3.0 Alpha1 release and was fixed 21-dec-2013.
#                     I could not reproduce poor statistics (too big value of fetches) on WI-T3.0.0.30566 (Alpha1 release),
#                     so temporary build was created based on snapshot of 20-dec-2013 (on POSIX): LI-T3.0.0.30800.
#                     This snapshot DOES reproduce problem: number of fetches for val=1 or val=3 is less than 30 
#                     while for val=2 produces number of fetches more than 210'000.
#                     For 2.5.x number of fetches is about 59...67, so common threshold was choosen to value 70.
#                  2. Test was refactored: querying to database 'mon-stat-gathering-N_M.fdb' was removed, all necessary
#                     output one may achieve by trivial view (v_mon) that queries mon$io_stats and and table (t_mon) that 
#                     serves as log.
#               
#                  Reproduced on LI-T3.0.0.30800 (snapshot on 20-dec-2013).
#                  Current results were checked on Windows (2.5.6.26994, 3.0.0.32484, 4.0.0.138) and POSIX (4.0.0.138)
