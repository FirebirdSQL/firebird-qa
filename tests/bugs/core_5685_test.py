ISSUE:       5951
TITLE:       Sometime it is impossible to cancel/kill connection executing external query
DESCRIPTION:
    Problem did appear when host "A" established connection to host "B" but could not get completed reply from this "B".
    This can be emulated by following steps:
    1. We establich new remote connection to the same database using EDS mechanism and supply completely new ROLE to force new attachment be created;
    2. Within this EDS we do query to selectable procedure (with name 'sp_unreachable') which surely will not produce any result.
       Bogon IP '192.0.2.2' is used in order to make this SP hang for sufficient time (on Windows it is about 20, on POSIX - about 44 seconds).
    Steps 1 and 2 are implemented by asynchronous call of ISQL: we must have ability to kill its process after.
    When this 'hanging ISQL' is launched, we wait 1..2 seconds and run one more ISQL, which has mission to KILL all attachments except his own.
    This ISQL session is named 'killer', and it writes result of actions to log.
    This "killer-ISQL" does TWO iterations with the same code which looks like 'select ... from mon$attachments' and 'delete from mon$attachments'.
    First iteration must return data of 'hanging ISQL' and also this session must be immediately killed.
    Second iteration must NOT return any data - and this is main check in this test.

    For builds which had bug (before 25.12.2017) one may see that second iteration STILL RETURNS the same data as first one:

NOTES:
    [06.10.2022] pzotov
        Fails on Linux when run in 'batch' mode (i.e. when pytest has to perform the whole tests set).
        Can not reproduce fail when run this test 'separately': it passes, but lasts too longm, ~130 s.
        Test will be re-implemented.
        DEFERRED.

    [03.02.2026] pzotov
        ::: ACHTUNG ::: In case of using VPN one need to add IP = 192.0.2.1 to exclusions list.
        TCP-request to this IP must be direct (i.e. bypass VPN).
        Otherwise script finishes INSTANTLY with 'connection rejected by remote interface'
        (instead of hang for ~20 seconds)

        Despite that 'killer' script completes relatively fast (for ~2...3s), database remains opened
        for approx 20s. Attempt to close DB file using 'gfix -shut' leads to SAME waiting ~20s.
        If we quit from this test without dropping such DB then next test_*.py (from QA set) will fail
        on attempt to create DB with same name ('object in use' will raise).
        Similar problem raises if we use db_factory with random file name because pytest attempts to
        drop entire directory defined as temporary storage for its run.
        Also, this problem will raise if this test outcome is verified multiple times via LOOP.

        Because of that, test creates DB in _OS_ temp directory rather than in Pytest temp folder.
        Name of DB matches to the pattern: 'core-5685.<random_str>.tmp'
        Special code at the start tries to make cleanup of OS diretory with removing all such files
        (and suppressing exception like 'PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access...')

        Confirmed bug on 4.0.0.483; 3.0.2.32703
        Confirmed fix in 4.0.0.840; 3.0.3.32900.
        Checked on Windows (all SS/CS): 6.0.0.1403; 5.0.4.1748; 4.0.7.3243; 3.0.14.33829
