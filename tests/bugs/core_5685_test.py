ISSUE:       5951
TITLE:       Sometime it is impossible to cancel/kill connection executing external query
DESCRIPTION:
  Problem did appear when host "A" established connection to host "B" but could not get completed reply from this "B".
  This can be emulated by following steps:
  1. We establich new remote connection to the same database using EDS mechanism and supply completely new ROLE to force new attachment be created;
  2. Within this EDS we do query to selectable procedure (with name 'sp_unreachable') which surely will not produce any result.
     Bogon IP '192.0.2.2' is used in order to make this SP hang for sufficient time (on Windows it is about 20, on POSIX - about 44 seconds).
  Steps 1 and 2 are implemented by asynchronous call of ISQL: we must have ability to kill its process after.
  When this 'hanging ISQL' is launched, we wait 1..2 seconds and run one more ISQL, which has mission to KILL all attachments except his own.
  This ISQL session is named 'killer', and it writes result of actions to log.
  This "killer-ISQL" does TWO iterations with the same code which looks like 'select ... from mon$attachments' and 'delete from mon$attachments'.
  First iteration must return data of 'hanging ISQL' and also this session must be immediately killed.
  Second iteration must NOT return any data - and this is main check in this test.

  For builds which had bug (before 25.12.2017) one may see that second iteration STILL RETURNS the same data as first one:
  ====
    ITERATION_NO                    1
    HANGING_ATTACH_CONNECTION       1
    HANGING_ATTACH_PROTOCOL         TCP
    HANGING_STATEMENT_STATE         1
    HANGING_STATEMENT_BLOB_ID       0:3
    select * from sp_get_data
    Records affected: 1

    ITERATION_NO                    2
    HANGING_ATTACH_CONNECTION       1
    HANGING_ATTACH_PROTOCOL         TCP
    HANGING_STATEMENT_STATE         1
    HANGING_STATEMENT_BLOB_ID       0:1
    select * from sp_get_data
    Records affected: 1
  ====
  (expected: all fields in ITER #2 must be NULL)

NOTES:
    [06.10.2022] pzotov
        Fails on Linux when run in 'batch' mode (i.e. when pytest has to perform the whole tests set).
        Can not reproduce fail when run this test 'separately': it passes, but lasts too longm, ~130 s.
        Test will be re-implemented.
        DEFERRED.
    [09.07.2024] pzotov
        Added item to substitutions related to 'port detached' message that raises in dev build.
        Fixed wrong logic because of missed indentation, see hang_stderr.
