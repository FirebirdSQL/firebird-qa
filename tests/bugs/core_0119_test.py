ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/441
TITLE:       Numeric div in dialect 3 mangles data
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    Results for FB 4.0 become differ from old one. Discussed with Alex, 30.10.2019.
    Precise value of 70000 / 1.95583 is: 35790.431683735296 (checked on https://www.wolframalpha.com )
    Section 'expected-stdout' was adjusted to be match for results that are issued in recent FB.
JIRA:        CORE-119
FBTEST:      bugs.core_0119
NOTES:
    Discussed with Alex see in e-mail, letters 30.10.2019.
    [21.06.2020] pzotov
        4.0.0.2068 (see also: CORE-6337):
        changed subtype from 0 to 1 for cast (-70000 as numeric (18,5)) / cast (1.95583 as numeric (18,5))
        (after discuss with dimitr, letter 21.06.2020 08:43).
    [25.06.2020] pzotov
        4.0.0.2076: changed types in SQLDA from numeric to int128 // after discuss with Alex about CORE-6342.
    [27.07.2021] pzotov
        adjusted expected* sections to results in current snapshots FB 4.x and 5.x: this is needed since fix #6874
        ("Literal 65536 (interpreted as int) can not be multiplied by itself w/o cast if result more than 2^63-1") because
        division -4611686018427387904/-0.5 does not issue error since this fix.
        Checked on 5.0.0.113, 4.0.1.2539.
    [10.12.2023] pzotov
        Added 'SQLSTATE' in substitutions: runtime error must be not be filtered out by '?!(...)' pattern
        ("negative lookahead assertion", see https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).
        Added 'combine_output = True' in order to see SQLSTATE if any error occurs.
