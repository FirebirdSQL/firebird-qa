ISSUE:       2513
TITLE:       Suboptimal join plan if there are selective non-indexed predicates involved
DESCRIPTION:
  This test operates with three tables: "small", "medium" and "big" - which are INNER-join'ed.
  It was found that there is some threshold ratio between number of rows in "small"  vs "medium"
  tables which affects on generated PLAN after reaching this ratio.
  In particular, when tables  have following values of rows: 26, 300 and 3000 - than optimizer
  still DOES take in account "WHERE" condition with non-indexed field in SMALL table ("where s.sf = 0"),
  and this lead to GOOD (fast) performance because SMALL table will be FIRST in the join order.
  However, if number of rows in SMALL table will change from 26 to 27 (yes, just one row) than
  optimizer do NOT consider additional condition (WHERE-filter) on that table and begin choose
  SLOW (ineffective) plan where MEDIUM table is first in join order.
  After discussion with dimitr, it was decided to:
    1) put here TWO cases of query: with "fast" and "slow" plan;
    2) replace too narrow threshold-pair (26 vs 27) with more wider (now: 15 and 45) because otherwise
       even minor changes in optimizer can breake this test expected output.
  Test make TWO PAIRS (i.e. total FOUR) runs:
    1. When number of rows in SMALL table is less than threshold:
    1.1. Without 'where'-filter on small table - to ensure that plan will contain MEDIUM table as first in join;
    1.2. WITH 'where'-filter on small table - to ensure that plan will be CHANGED and SMALL table will be first;
    2. When number of rows in SMALL table is beyond the threshold:
    2.1. Without 'where'-filter on small table - plan will contain MEDIUM table as first in join;
    2.2. WITH 'where'-filter on small table - plan will NOT changed, MEDIUM table will remain first in join.
  Beside output of PLAN itself, test also:
    1) displays index statistics
    2) compares fetches with some 'upper-limit' constants in order to alert us in case when fetches become too high.
  These constants have been obtained after sereval experiments with page_size = 4k, and their values are base on
  following typical results (which are the same on 2.5 and 3.0):
  FETCHES_1_1                     19636
  FETCHES_1_2                     9094
  FETCHES_2_1                     19548
  FETCHES_2_2                     19548
NOTES:
[18.08.2020]
  Test uses pre-created database which has several procedures for analyzing performance by with the help of MON$ tables.
  Performance results are gathered in the table STAT_LOG, each odd run will save mon$ counters with "-" sign and next
  (even) run will save them with "+" -- see SP_GATHER_STAT.
  Aggegation of results is done in the view V_AGG_STAT (negative values relate to start, positive to the end of measure,
  difference between them means performance expenses which we want to evaluate).
  NOTE. Before each new measure we have to set generator G_GATHER_STAT to zero in order to make it produce proper values
  starting with 1 (odd --> NEGATIVE sign for counters). This is done in SP_TRUNCATE_STAT.
[18.08.2020]
  FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
  statement 'alter sequence <seq_name> restart with 0' changes rdb$generators.rdb$initial_value to -1 thus next call
  gen_id(<seq_name>,1) will return 0 (ZERO!) rather than 1.
  See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d

  This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt

  Because of this, it was decided to change code of SP_TRUNCATE_STAT: instead of 'alter sequence restart...' we do
  reset like this: c = gen_id(g_gather_stat, -gen_id(g_gather_stat, 0));
