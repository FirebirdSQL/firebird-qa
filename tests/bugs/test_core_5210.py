# title:        Firebird 3.0 + fbclient 3.0 - POST_EVENT won't work
# decription:   
#                   We create database-level trigger which sends event with name 'dml_event' on COMMIT.
#                   Then we do new connect and run thread with INSERT statement (with delay = 1.0 second), and wait 
#                   NO MORE than <max4delivering> sec.
#                   We should receive event during ~ 1.0 second. 
#                   We have to consider result as FAIL if we do not receive event in <max4delivering> seconds.
#                   Result of "events.wait(max4delivering)" will be non-empty dictionary with following key-value:
#                     {'dml_event': 1} - when all fine and client got event;
#                     {'dml_event': 0} - when NO event was delivered
#                   All such actions are repeated several times in order to increase probability of failure if something
#                   in FB will be broken.
#               
#                   Confirmed wrong result on: 4.0.0.145, V3.0.0.32493 - with probability approx 60%.
#                   All fine on: T4.0.0.150, WI-V3.0.0.32496 (SS/SC/CS).
