ISSUE:       4708
TITLE:       Report more details for "object in use" errors
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-4386
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4386
NOTES:
    [22.11.2021] pcisar
    This test requires READ_COMMITTED_NO_RECORD_VERSION transaction to work, which
    requires ReadConsistency disabled in FB 4. However, it does not work as expected
    because all drop commands pass without exception even with ReadConsistency disabled.
    The same happens under 3.0.8 (no errors raised).
    [17.09.2022] pzotov
    1. Test actually must work identical for *every* isolation mode of all possible set.
    2. One need to be very careful with object that attempts to make COMMIT after DROP statement:
       if we use custom TPB, start transaction explicitly and 'bind' DDL cursor to this transaction
       then we have to run commit *exactly* by this TRANSACTION rather then connection whoch owns it!
       See 'tx2.commit()' in the code. If we replace it with 'con2.commit()' then Tx2 will be 
       *silently* rolled back (!!despite that we issued con.commit() !!) and we will not get any
       error messages. I'm not sure whether this correct or no.
    Checked on 3.0.8.33535 (SS/CS), 4.0.1.2692 (SS/CS), 5.0.0.730

    [22.08.2024] pzotov
    * Changed DDL because of SubQueryConversion config parameter appearance.
      We have to AVOID usage of queries which have plan that can be changed when firebird.conf has
      SubQueryConversion = true. In that case some index can be excluded from plan and thus
      it can be dropped on first iteration of 'for x_isol in tx_isol_lst' loop. This causes unexpected
      error 'index not found' for subsequent checks.
    * Added check for error message when we try to drop standalone function.
    * Assert moved out to the point after loop in order to show whole result in case of some error
      (rather than only one message block for some particular x_isol).
    * Excluded check of FB 3.x (this version no more changed).

    Checked on 6.0.0.442, 5.0.2.1479, 4.0.6.3142
