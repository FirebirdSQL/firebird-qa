ISSUE:       674
TITLE:       ISQL and database dialect
DESCRIPTION:
  ::: NB :::
  ### Name of original test has no any relation with actual task of this test: ###
  https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/fbtcs/blob/master/GTCS/tests/CF_ISQL_25.script

  When ISQL disconnects from database (either by dropping it or by trying to connect to
  non-existent database) is still remembers its sql dialect, which can lead to some
  inappropriate warning messages.

  Issue in original script: bug #910430 ISQL and database dialect
  Found in FB tracker as: http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-337
  Fixed in 2.0 Beta 1
JIRA:        CORE-337
