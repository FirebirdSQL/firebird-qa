ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7687
TITLE:       Add LEVEL column to PLG$PROF_RECORD_SOURCES and PLG$PROF_RECORD_SOURCE_STATS_VIEW
DESCRIPTION:
    Test creates master-detail tables and view 'v_test' for them.
    Then we create auxiliary view 'vp_rec_stats' to see profiler data.
    Running query to 'v_test' will add data to profiler snapshot tables so that we must have ability
    to reconstruct the whole EXPLAINED PLAN of that query, i.e. with top-level and all subsequent access paths.
    This reconstruction is performed by recursive query which first gets records with 'parent_record_source_id is null'
    (and all these records always have LEVEL = 0), and then goes down according to the principle:
    "give be lines with level that be bigger but CLOSEST to current one". This is achieved by applying dense_rank()
    function, see 'ranked_level' column usage and notes below.
NOTES:
    [25.08.2023] pzotov
    1.  We can NOT use "next level must be current one plus 1" in recursive part of query that reconstructs explained plan!
        This is because some access paths can be 'splitted' onto one or several 'sub-paths' by LF character, thus they are looked
        to be somewhat as 'multi-line' parts. Every LF in such case causes LEVEL to be "sinlently" increased by 1, so lines
        AFTER this "complex" access path will have LEVEL that differs from source for MORE than 1.

        Here is example of such data (there is NO record with LEVEL = 3):
            STTM_ID   LEVEL  REC_ID  PAR_ID ACC_PATH                                           SQL_TEXT
            ======= ======= ======= ======= ================================================== ==================================================
               5760       0       1  <null> Select Expression                                  select first 1 r.* from rdb$database r order by 1
               5760       1       2       1   -> First N Records                               select first 1 r.* from rdb$database r order by 1
               5760       2       3       2     -> Refetch
                -> Sort (record length: 36, key select first 1 r.* from rdb$database r order by 1
               5760       4       4       3         -> Table "RDB$DATABASE" as "R" Full Scan   select first 1 r.* from rdb$database r order by 1

        This was implemented intentionally with purpose to make reconstruction of indents easier.
        Because of that, view that queries PLG$PROF_ tables must use "dense_rank()over(order by t.level)".
    2.  We have to make additional (preliminary) call to rdb$profiler.start_session() / .finish_session() BEFORE test in order to create view
        that is based on profiler snapshot tables. Otherwise error raises:
            SQLSTATE = 42S02 / ... / -Table unknown / -PLG$PROF_RECORD_SOURCE_STATS_VIEW
        See: doc/sql.extensions/README.profiler.md
        "Snapshot tables (as well views and sequence) are automatically created in the first usage of the profiler"
    3.  Currently there is problem with distinguish 'blocks' from profiler data that corresponds to sub-queries: there is no column that applies
        to the whole block and lines that belong (by hierarchy) to subquery can be displayed either before or after lines that relate to 'main'
        part of query. Although it seems that subquery is mostly displayed *after* main part.
        Because of that, it was decided for now to leave expected output as it is produced by current FB versions.
        If future runs will show that subquery part "jumps" randomly (from "top" to "bottom") than only presense of top-level access paths
        will be checked (without requirement to their concrete order).
    4.  In order to see indents properly (including case if they will change in size) we have to prefix each line ('#' character is used).
    5.  Initial discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/firebird-devel/c/dWIgSIemys4/m/TzUWYwmVAQAJ?pli=1

    Checked on 5.0.0.1169.

    [29.09.2023] pzotov
    Replaces expected output to be matched to current FB 5.x and 6.x snapshots.
    Added substitution to disable output of BLOB_ID values because access_path type is BLOB since 19-sep-2023
    (see https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/39b019574a7eb23eff92ee71121043d9a9c8371f )

    [19-dec-2023] pzotov
    Removed 'rand()' in order to have predictable values in table column. Use mod() instead.
    Unstable outcomes started since 6.0.0.180 (18.12.2023).
    It seems that following commits caused this:
