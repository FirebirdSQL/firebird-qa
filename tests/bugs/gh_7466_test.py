ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7466
TITLE:       Add COMPILE trace events for procedures/functions/triggers
DESCRIPTION:
    Test prepares trace config with requrement to see events related to units compilation.
    We create standalone procedure, standalone function and package with procedure and function.
    Also, we create three type of triggers: for a table, for DB-level event ('on connect') and for any DDL statement.
    Then test launches trace session and runs ISQL with appropriate script with above mentioned actions.

    Finally, we parse trace log and filter only lines containing names of created PSQL units which we know.
    No errors must present in the trace log. All created units must be specified in blocks related to compilation.
NOTES:
    [17-aug-2023] pzotov
    ::: NB :::
    0. This test DOES NOT check tracking of plans for queries inside those PSQL modules (i.e. strarting ticket issue,
       see: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7466#issue-1564439735 ).
       SEPARATE TEST WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THAT.
    1. It must be noted that the term 'COMPILE' means parsing of BLR code into an execution tree, i.e. this action
       occurs when unit code is loaded into metadata cache. 
    2. Procedures and functions are loaded into metadata cache immediatelly when they are created.
    3. Triggers are loaded into metadata cache in 'deferred' way, when something occurs that causes trigger to fire.
       So, DML trigger will fire when we do (for example) INSERT, DB_level trigger - when we do some action on DB level
       (e.g. connect/disconnect), and similar to DDL trigger.
    4. Currently there is no way to specify in the trace what EXACT type of DDL trigger fired. It is shown as "AFTER DDL".
    5. Lot of system-related triggers are displayed in the trace log during creating user-defined units:
           Trigger RDB$TRIGGER_26 FOR RDB$RELATION_CONSTRAINTS
           Trigger RDB$TRIGGER_18 FOR RDB$INDEX_SEGMENTS (BEFORE UPDATE)
           Trigger RDB$TRIGGER_8 FOR RDB$USER_PRIVILEGES (BEFORE DELETE)
       etc. Test ignores them and takes in account only triggers that have been creates by "our" SQL script.
    6. User-defined DDL trigger will be loaded into metadata cache MULTIPLE times (three in this test: for create view,
       its altering and its dropping - although there is no re-connect between these actions). This is conisdered as bug,
       see: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7426 (currently it is not yet fixed).
    
    Thanks to dimitr for explanations.
    Discussed with dimitr, letters 17.08.2023.

    Checked on 5.0.0.1164
