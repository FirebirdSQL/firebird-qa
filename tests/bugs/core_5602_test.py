ISSUE:       5868
TITLE:       Slow changes on domain
DESCRIPTION:
   Poor performance was reproduced after discuss with Vlad (14.09.2017).
   Test restores DB which has 20 tables, each with 20 fields based on domain 
   (i.e. 'create table t_NN(f_N bool_emul, ...)', where NN=1,2, ..., 20).
   Also it has 20 stored procedures, and each of these SP has 20 input 
   and 20 output parameters declared as 'type of column t_NN.field_NN'
   NOTE. We have to SKIP preparing phase of such DB because DDL vasts 
   too much time, so this database was created once and then stored as fbk.
   After restoring we only run:
   1) alter domain drop constraint; 
   2) commit;
   3) alter domain add check; 
   4) commit;
   -- and measure elapsed time of each step (we store time in context variables).
   Then we evaluate DATEDIFF() for each of 1...4 steps and two RATIOS:
   A) 'alter domain drop constraint' vs commit just after it;
   B) 'alter domain add check' vs commit just after it;

   RESULTS of dozen measures :
   ==========================
   * on build 31798 (17-aug-2017) ratio for 20 tables, 20 fields and 20 SPs was more than 100
     (i.e. 'ALTER DOMAIN ADD | DROP' ran ~100x slower than COMMIT);
   * on build 32802 (06-sep-2017) ratio is about 0.1 (YES, 'alter domain' runs FASTER ~10x than commit!)

   Threshold in this test is assigned to 1 - I hope it will be enough for all subsequent builds of 3.0 and 4.0.

   Checked on:
       fb30Cs, build 3.0.3.32802: OK, 5.312s.
       FB30SS, build 3.0.3.32802: OK, 4.297s.
       FB40CS, build 4.0.0.744: OK, 7.484s.
       FB40SS, build 4.0.0.744: OK, 7.140s.

   Here is auxiliary batch that allows to get DB with arbitrary number of tables/fields and SPs:
