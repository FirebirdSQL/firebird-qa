ISSUE:       1956
TITLE:       Predicate IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM is not pushed into unions/aggregates thus causing sub-optimal plans
DESCRIPTION:
  Implementation for 3.0 does NOT use 'set explain on' (decision after discuss with Dmitry, letter 02-sep-2015 15:42).
  Test only checks that:
  1) in case when NATURAL scan occured currently index T*_SINGLE_X is used;
  2) in case when it was only PARTIAL matching index Y*_COMPOUND_X is in use.
JIRA:        CORE-4921
