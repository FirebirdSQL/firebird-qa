ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/3810
TITLE:       Wrong or missing IS NULL optimization (regression) [CORE3449]
NOTES:
    [14.04.2023] pzotov
    Confirmed poor performance on 3.0.11.33678 (num of fetches = 10'099).
    Checked on 3.0.11.33681 -- all fine, fetches differ for less than 20.

    [22.09.2023] pzotov
    Changed name of table to simpler. 
    Removed usage of index test_fld2 after discuss with Anton Zuev (Red Soft) and dimitr,
    see: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-qa/pull/19
