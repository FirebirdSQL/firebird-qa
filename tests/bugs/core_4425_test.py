ISSUE:       1551
TITLE:       User-collations based on UNICODE are not upgrade to newer ICU version on restore
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses .fbk which was created on linux host and has collation with following DDL:
    create collation nums_coll for utf8 from unicode case insensitive 'NUMERIC-SORT=1';
    SHOW COLLATION on linux host did show: COLL-VERSION=49.192.5.41.

    We restore this database and try to use existing collation again.
JIRA:        CORE-4425
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4425
NOTES:
    [05.12.2025] pzotov
    Added column name for expression 's1=s2' otherwise separate expected_out must be
    used since fixed #8820 (currently only for 6.x).
    Checked on 6.0.0.1364; 5.0.4.1737; 4.0.7.3237; 3.0.14.33829.
