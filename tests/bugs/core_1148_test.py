# title:        Every user can view server log using services API
# decription:   
#                  Instead of usage 'resource:test_user' (as it was before) we create every time this test run  user TMP$C1148
#                  and make test connect to database as this user in order to check ability to connect and get engine version.
#                  Then we parse engine version (is it 2.5 or 3.0 ?) and construct command to obtain Firebird log using FBSVCMGR
#                  (switches differ for 2.5 and 3.0! For 2.5 it must be: "action_get_ib_log", for 3.0: "action_get_fb_log").
#                  After that we try to extract firebird log using fbsvcmgr and this command is EXPECTED return error, so we log
#                  this message to separate file (and STDOUT is redirected to /dev/null).
#                  Finally, we check content of 1st and 2nd files and remove temply created user.
