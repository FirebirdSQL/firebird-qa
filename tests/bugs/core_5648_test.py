ISSUE:       5914
TITLE:       Avoid serialization of isc_attach_database calls issued by EXECUTE STATEMENT implementation
DESCRIPTION:
  We use special IP = 192.0.2.2 as never reachable address thus any attempt to connect it will fail.
  Currently FB tries to establish connect to this host about 20-22 seconds.
  We launch 1st ISQL in Async mode (using subprocess.Popen) with task to establish connect to this host.
  At the same time we launch 2nd ISQL with EDS to localhost and the same DB as test uses.
  Second ISQL must do its job instantly, despite of hanging 1st ISQl, and time for this is about 50 ms.
  We use threshold and compare time for which 2nd ISQL did its job. Finally, we ouptput result of this comparison.
NOTES:
  As of current FB snapshots, there is NOT ability to interrupt ISQL which tries to make connect to 192.0.2.2,
  until this ISQL __itself__ make decision that host is unreachable. This takes about 20-22 seconds.
  Also, if we kill this (hanging) ISQL process, than we will not be able to drop database until this time exceed.
  For this reason, it was decided not only to kill ISQL but also run fbsvcmgr with DB full-shutdown command - this
  will ensure that database is really free from any attachments and can be dropped.
