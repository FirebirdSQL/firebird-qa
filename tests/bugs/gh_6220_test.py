ISSUE:       6220
TITLE:       Slow performance when executing SQL scripts as non-SYSDBA user
DESCRIPTION:
    Confirmed poor ratio between sysdba/non_dba time on 3.0.4.33054 (03-oct-2018): ratio was about 3.5 ... 4.0.
    Bug was fixed in 3.0.5, 11-nov-2018, build #33081 ( https://www.sql.ru/forum/actualutils.aspx?action=gotomsg&tid=1295388&msg=21800371 ).
    Recent FB versions have no problem, ratio is about 1.05 ... 1.15.

    Problem can be preproduced if each DML prepare will require lot of work, for example - check access rights for many nested views before
    update underlying table.
  NOTES:
JIRA:        CORE-5966
FBTEST:      bugs.gh_6220
NOTES:
    [30.11.2021] pzotov
    Completely reworked: use psutil package in order to take in account CPU User Time instead of evaluating datediff.
    Difference between CPU User Time values which are received before and after each call of stored procedure can be considered as much more
    accurate way to evaluate time that was spent for job.

    Test creates table and lot of nested views based on this table and (furter) on each other.
    Then stored procedure is created with DYNAMIC SQL, and we intentionally do NOT use parameters in it (because we want engine to compile
    statement on each iteration).
    Procedure performs loop for <N_COUNT_PER_MEASURE> times with executing statement like 'UPDATE <top_level_view> SET <new values here on each iteration>'.
    Engine needs to determine access rights not only for <top_level_view> but also for all NESTED views and, eventually, for underlying table which must be
    updated.
    We call this procedure N_MEASURES times for SYSDBA and the same (N_MEASURES times) for NON_DBA user, and store difference values between CPU User Time
    counters for each call. These differences then are divided (value that was received for NON_DBA is divided for apropriate value of SYSDBA).
    MEDIAN of these ratios must be LESS than threshold MAX_TIME_RATIO.

    [21.06.2022] pzotov
    Confirmed problem on  3.0.4.32972 (build of 11-may-2018).
    Refactored initial DDL (made it shorter because of dynamic list/string creation - see 'NESTED_LIMIT' variable).
    Checked on 3.0.8.33535, 4.0.1.2692, 5.0.0.509 -- both Windows and Linux.
