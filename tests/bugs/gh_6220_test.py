# title:        Slow performance when executing SQL scripts as non-SYSDBA user [CORE5966]
# decription:   
#                   https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6220
#               
#                   Confirmed poor ratio between sysdba/non_dba time on 3.0.4.33054 (03-oct-2018): ratio was about 3.5 ... 4.0.
#                   Bug was fixed in 3.0.5, 11-nov-2018, build #33081 ( https://www.sql.ru/forum/actualutils.aspx?action=gotomsg&tid=1295388&msg=21800371 ).
#               
#                   Recent FB versions have no problem, ratio is about 1.05 ... 1.15.
#               
#                   Problem can be preproduced if each DML prepare will require lot of work, for example - check access rights for many nested views before
#                   update underlying table.
#               
#                   30.11.2021. Completely reworked: use psutil package in order to take in account CPU User Time instead of evaluating datediff.
#                   Difference between CPU User Time values which are received before and after each call of stored procedure can be considered as much more
#                   accurate way to evaluate time that was spent for job.
#               
#                   Test creates table and lot of nested views based on this table and (furter) on each other.
#                   Then stored procedure is created with DYNAMIC SQL, and we intentionally do NOT use parameters in it (because we want engine to compile
#                   statement on each iteration).
#                   Procedure performs loop for <N_COUNT_PER_MEASURE> times with executing statement like 'UPDATE <top_level_view> SET <new values here on each iteration>'.
#                   Engine needs to determine access rights not only for <top_level_view> but also for all NESTED views and, eventually, for underlying table which must be
#                   updated.
#                   We call this procedure N_MEASURES times for SYSDBA and the same (N_MEASURES times) for NON_DBA user, and store difference values between CPU User Time
#                   counters for each call. These differences then are divided (value that was received for NON_DBA is divided for apropriate value of SYSDBA).
#                   MEDIAN of these ratios must be LESS than threshold MAX_TIME_RATIO.
#               
#                   Checked on:
#                       5.0.0.321 : 18.426s.
#                       4.0.1.2672 : 18.469s.
#                       3.0.8.33540 : 18.220s.
