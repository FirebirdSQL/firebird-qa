ISSUE:       6001
TITLE:       Invalid parameters of gds transaction in ISQL
DESCRIPTION:
  ISQL hangs when trying to show various system objects in a case when other attachment has uncommitted changes to that objects
  We create (in Python connection) one table TEST1 with PK and commit transaction.
  Then we create second (similar) table TEST2 but do not commit transaction.
  After this we launch ISQL in async. mode and ask him to perform SHOW TABLE and SHOW INDEX commands.
  ISQL:
  1) should NOT hang (it did this because of launching Tx in read committed NO record_version);
  2) should output only info about table TEST1 and ints PK index.
  3) should not output any info about non-committed DDL of table TEST2.

  Confirmed bug on 3.0.3.32837 and 4.0.0.800 (ISQL did hang when issued any of 'SHOW TABLE' / 'SHOW INDEX' copmmand).
