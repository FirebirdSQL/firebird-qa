ISSUE:       6514
TITLE:       Failed attach to database not traced
DESCRIPTION:
  NB: connect to services must be done using LOCAL protocol rather than remote.
  Otherwise trace log will have only records about connect/disconnect to security.db.
  NO messages about failed search of non-existing database will appear.
  This is known bug, see Alex's issue in the tracker, 07-apr-2020 10:39.
NOTES:
[04.03.2021]
  Adapted to be run both on Windows and Linux.
  NOTE-1. There is difference between Windows and Linux message for gdscode = 335544344:
    * WINDOWS: 335544344 : I/O error during "CreateFile (open)" operation ...
    * LINUX:   335544344 : I/O error during "open" operation ...
  NOTE-2. Some messages can appear in the trace log ONE or TWO times (SS/CS ?).
  Because of this, we are interested only for at least one occurence of each message
  rather than for each of them (see 'found_patterns', type: set()).
