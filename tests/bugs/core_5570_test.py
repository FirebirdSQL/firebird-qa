ISSUE:       5837
TITLE:       Negative infinity (double) shown incorrectly without sign in isql
DESCRIPTION:
  Bug was in ISQL. We do insert in the table with two DP fields special values which
  are "-1.#INF" and "1.#INF" (at least in such view they are represented in the trace).
  These values are defined in Python class Decimal as literals '-Infinity' and 'Infinity'.
  After this we try to query this table. Expected result: "minus" sign should be shown
  leftside of negative infinity.
JIRA:        CORE-5570
