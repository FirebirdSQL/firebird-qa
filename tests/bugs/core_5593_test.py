# title:        System function RDB$ROLE_IN_USE cannot take long role names
# decription:   
#                  Test creates several roles and grants them to user.
#                  Role #1 is common ascii string without spaces.
#                  Role #2 is ascii string with spaces, all character are written in UPPERCASE.
#                  Role #3 is ascii string with spaces, all character are written in lowercase.
#               
#                  After make connection to database using role #3 we have to check that this role
#                  indeed was applied to connection and that rdb$role_in_use *does* return this role name also.
#                  See also: github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/61b4bf0d276884a0ba0f2edef3b41fa2c58c87ee
#                  Comments there:
#                       - roleStr.upper();
#                       + //roleStr.upper();		// sorry - but this breaks role names containing lower case letters
#               
#               
#                  ::: NB CAUTION ::: TEMPLY DEFERRED :::
#                  We also have to check cases when role contains NON-ASCII characters but currently this is impossible.
#                  Exception like:
#                  ===
#                     Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 22001
#                     arithmetic exception, numeric overflow, or string truncation
#                     -string right truncation
#                     -expected length 63, actual 79
#                  ===
#                  - is raised when non-ascii role contains only ~40 *characters* and connection charset = UTF8.
