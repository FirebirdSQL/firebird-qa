ISSUE:       6887
TITLE:       Invalid SIMILAR TO patterns may lead memory read beyond string limits
DESCRIPTION:
    On 5.0.0.88 and 4.0.1.2523 expression marked as [ 2 ] raises:
    "SQLSTATE = 22025/Invalid ESCAPE sequence",
    After fix its error became the same as for [ 1 ].

    NB: backslash character must be duplicated when SQL script is launched from Python,
    in contrary to common usage (pass script to ISQL utility from OS command prompt).
