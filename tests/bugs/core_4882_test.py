# title:        ISQL input command (or -i option) reads large (> 64K) lines incorrectly
# decription:
#                   This test verifies ability of parsing multiple statements that are going as `single-lined stream`.
#                   Source for this test is file `fbt-repo\\files\\core_4882.sql`.
#                   It contains almost all source code of test that emulates OLTP workload - without initial script for data filling.
#                   This test can be found here: svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/firebird/code/qa/oltp-emul/
#                   Three files were taken from it: oltp30_DDL.sql, oltp30_sp.sql and oltp_main_filling.sql - with total size  ~600 Kb.
#                   Then all single-lined comments ("-- blah blah ...") were removed and remained source code was pulled out in single-line.
#                   This single-line also could not be compiled up to WI-V3.0.0.31948, raising 'token unknown'.
#                   No error on compiling should occur since buiild WI-V3.0.0.31981.
#                   NOTE: before this file also contained lines with bulk of begin..end blocks but since CORE-4884 was fixed that number
#                   is limited to 512. With this limit single-line statement of begin-end blocks will have length less than 64K. For that
#                   reason these lines were removed from here to the test for CORE-4884.
