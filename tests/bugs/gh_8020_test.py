ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8020
TITLE:       AV when both function and dependent table are dropped in the same transaction
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    [12.03.2024] pzotov
    1. Crash occured only when connection is done via TCP protocol.
    2. Another bug currently *remains* in FB 6.x if DROP-statements are in DSQL form, i.e are not 'enclosed' in PSQL and begin/end blocks:
           ==========
           Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 39000
           unsuccessful metadata update
           -DROP TABLE T_FN failed
           -invalid request BLR at offset 1
           -function F is not defined
           ==========
       See https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8021 (currently not fixed).
       Because of this, it was decided to run DROP statements within PSQL code.
    3. Test checks whether MON$SERVER_PID remains the same after execution of DROP statements. In case of crash this is not so.

    Confirmed bug on 6.0.0.268
    Checked on 6.0.0.269
