ISSUE:       4422
TITLE:       Wrong parameters order in trace output
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
[07.07.2016]
  WI-T4.0.0.238 will issue in trace log following parametrized statement:
  ===
  with recursive role_tree as (
    select rdb$relation_name as nm, 0 as ur from rdb$user_privileges
    where
      rdb$privilege = 'M' and rdb$field_name = 'D'
      and rdb$user = ?  and rdb$user_type = 8
    union all
    select rdb$role_name as nm, 1 as ur from rdb$roles
    where rdb$role_name =...

  param0 = varchar(93), "SYSDBA"
  param1 = varchar(93), "NONE"
  ===

  This statement will issued BEFORE our call of stored procedure, so we have to analyze
  lines from trace only AFTER we found pattern 'execute procedure sp_test'.
