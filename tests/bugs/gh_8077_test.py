ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8077
TITLE:       Error "Too many recursion levels" does not stop execuition of code that uses ON DISCONNECT trigger (FB 4.x+)
DESCRIPTION:
    Test creates DB-triggers 'ON CONNECT' and 'ON DISCONNECT', plus table 'LOG' for logging actions performed by DB-triggers.
    Trigger 'ON DISCONNECT' makes EDS with new role thus creating new connection which will then be immediately finished and,
    in turn, fire again this trigger. Eventually this must cause ISQL to terminate and firebird.log must contain errors.
    Difference between old and new firebird.log must contain exactly two errors about detahc problem
    (Error at disconnect: / Execute statement error at attach : / 335544830 : Too many recursion levels of EXECUTE STATEMENT)
NOTES:
    [27.05.2024] pzotov
    Time of ISQL execution is limited by MAX_WAIT_FOR_ISQL_TERMINATE seconds. Currently it is ~6s for SS and ~18s for CS.

    [08.06.2024] pzotov
    Added threshold in order to prevent infinite recursion in case of regression.
    Otherwise this test can cause collapse of test machine because of infinite launch of firebird processes (in case of Classic).
    See notes in the code below, variable 'STOP_RECURSIVE_ES_AFTER_ITER'.
    Checked on snapshot 5.x that was not yet fixed.

    Checked on 6.0.0.362, 5.0.1.1408, 4.0.5.3103 (all SS/CS).

# We have to define generator and increment it on each DB-level trigger invocation in order to prevent infinite loop

# calls will be executed if generator exceeds this threshold.
