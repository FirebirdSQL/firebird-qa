ISSUE:       2731
TITLE:       Incomplete API information values
DESCRIPTION:
  Test creates lot of tables with names starting with 'TEST'.
  Then we retrieve from rdb$relations min and max values of this tables ID ('r_min', 'r_max').
  After each table is scanned via execute statement, statistics that we retrieve by call db_into()
  is filled with pair: {relation_id, number_of_seq_reads}.
  We have to ckeck that number of entries in this set with r_min <= relation_id <= rmax NOT LESS than
  number of created tables.
  Also, scan for every table should take at least 1 sequential read - and this is checked too.

  NOTE: we can SKIP checking concrete values of 'number_of_seq_reads', it does not matter in this test!

  Info about 'isc_info_read_seq_count':
  Number of sequential database reads, that is, the number of sequential table scans (row reads)
     Reported per table.
     Calculated since the current database attachment started.

  Confirmed bug on WI-V2.1.2.18118: db_into() received imcompleted data (i.e. not for all tables).
