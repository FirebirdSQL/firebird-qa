ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7767
TITLE:       Slow drop trigger command execution under FB5.0
DESCRIPTION:
    The issued problem can NOT be stably reproduced if we compare time ratio between 'DROP TRIGGER' vs 'DROP PROCEDURE' statements.
    ratio between execution time differed for too small value (e.g. 7.2 before fix and 6.9 after it).

    But regression can be noted if we check ratio between CPU time spent for 'DROP TRIGGER' and some code that does not relate
    to any DB operations and makes some evaluation. Such code can be single call to CRYPT_HASH function (doing in loop many times).
    This function must be called EVAL_CRYPT_HASH_COUNT times.
    Result of evaluating of CRYPT_HASH is stored in var. 'eval_crypt_hash_time' and serves further as "etalone" value.

    Test database is initialized by creation of PSQL_OBJECTS_COUNT triggers and is copied to backup FDB (see 'tmp_fdb').
    Then we call 'DROP TRIGGER' using 'for select ... from rdb$triggers' cursor (so their count is also PSQL_OBJECTS_COUNT).
    We repeat this in loop for MEASURES_COUNT iterations, doing restore from DB copy before every iteration (copy 'tmp_fdb' to act.db).
    Median of ratios between CPU times obtained in this loop and eval_crypt_hash_time must be less than MAX_RATIO.
    Duration is measured as difference between psutil.Process(fb_pid).cpu_times() counters.
NOTES:
    [14.08.2024] pzotov
    Problem did exist in FB 5.x until commit "Fix #7759 - Routine calling overhead increased by factor 6 vs Firebird 4.0.0."
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/d621ffbe0cf2d43e13480628992180c28a5044fe (03-oct-2023 13:32).
    Before this commit (up to 5.0.0.1236) median of ratios was more than 6.5.
    After fix it was reduced to ~3.5 ... 4.0 (5.0.0.1237 and above).
    This ratio seems to be same on Windows and Linux.

    Built-in function CRYPT_HASH appeared in 4.0.0.2180, 27-aug-2020, commit:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/e9f3eb360db41ddff27fa419b908876be0d2daa5
    ("Moved cryptographic hashes to separate function crypt_hash(), crc32 - into function hash()")

    Test duration time: about 50s.
    Checked on 6.0.0.436, 5.0.2.1478, 4.0.6.3142 (all SS/CS; both Windows and Linux).
