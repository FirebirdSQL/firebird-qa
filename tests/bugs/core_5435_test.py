ISSUE:       5707
TITLE:       Badly selective index could be used for extra filtering even if selective index is used for sorting
DESCRIPTION:
  Test creates table and fills it with data like it was specified in the source ticket,
  but query has been CHANGED after discuss with dimitr (see letter 19-jan-2017 08:43):
  instead of 'f01 is null' we use 'f01 = 1' because actually problem that was fixed
  is NOT related with NULL handling.
  Usage of NULL will hide effect of improvement in optimizer because there is old bug
  in FB from early years which prevent engine from fast navigate on index (i.e. PLAN ORDER)
  when expression is like 'is NULL'.

  Implementation details: we start trace and run ISQL with query, then stop trace, open its log
  and parse it with seeking lines with 'plan (' and 'fetch(es)'.
  Expected plan:
    PLAN (TEST ORDER TEST_F01_ID) -- confirmed on WI-T4.0.0.503
    0 ms, 3 read(s), 44 fetch(es)
  WRONG (ineffective) plan:
    PLAN (TEST ORDER TEST_F01_ID INDEX (TEST_F02_ONLY)) -- detected on WI-T4.0.0.463
    21 ms, 115 read(s), 157 fetch(es)
Value of fetches is compared with threshold (currently = 80) which was received after several runs.
