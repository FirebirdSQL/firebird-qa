ISSUE:       5348
TITLE:       ISQL plan output is unexpectedly truncated after a query is simplified to become shorter
DESCRIPTION:
  Start of discussion: letter to dimitr, 30-dec-2015 13:57; its subject refers to core-4708.
  It was found that explained plan produced by ISQL is unexpectedly ends on WI-V3.0.0.32256.
  This test uses that query, but instead of verifying plan text itself (which can be changed in the future)
  it is sufficient to check only that plan does NOT contain lines with ellipsis or 'truncated' or 'error'.
  This mean that 'expected_stdout' section must be EMPTY. Otherwise expected_stdout will contain info
  about error or invalid plan.
