ISSUE:       6293
TITLE:       GTTs do not release used space
DESCRIPTION:
    1) runs loop for two iterations (see 'for ClrRetainGTT in (0,1): ...')
    2) on each iteration:
       2.1)  makes copy of test DB to the file which is specified in databases.conf as 
             database for alias with name = 'tmp_core_6043_gtt_0_alias', 'tmp_core_6043_gtt_1_alias'.
             NOTE: it is supposed that we have pre-created databases.conf with these TWO ALIASES,
             and each of them have in its details parameter ClearGTTAtRetaining = 0 and 1 respectively.
       2.2) launches ISQL which must connect to appropriate alias and execute script from ticket;
    3) checks that:
      3.1) for ClearGTTAtRetaining = 0 (value for backward compatibility):
          * COMMIT RETAIN preserves record that was inserted in the statement before this commit;
          * ROLLBACK RETAIN does NOT delete record that was inserted before COMMIT RETAIN.
      3.2) for ClearGTTAtRetaining = 1 (default value) NO records will be in the GTT after commit/rollback RETAIN.
JIRA:        CORE-6043
FBTEST:      bugs.core_6043
NOTES:
    [06.08.2022] pzotov
    Confirmed problem on 3.0.5.33115 (snapshot date: 26-mar-2019):
    records for commit/rollback retain were NOT preserved despite setting ClearGTTAtRetaining = 0.
    Previous checks:
        4.0.0.1687 SS: 1.536s.
        4.0.0.1685 CS: 2.026s.
        3.0.5.33207 SS: 1.435s.
        3.0.5.33152 SC: 1.243s.
        3.0.5.33206 CS: 2.626s.
    Checked on 5.0.0.591, 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - both on Windows and Linux.

    [01.12.2023] pzotov
    Adjusted pytest.mark.version: test can run only on FB 3.x and 4.x.
    Config parameter ClearGTTAtRetaining was removed from FB 5.x+
    (see "Task #7897 : Remove obsolete setting ClearGTTAtRetaining").
