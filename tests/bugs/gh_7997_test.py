ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7997
TITLE:       Unexpected results when comparing integer with string containing value out of range of that integer datatype
NOTES:
    [11.03.2024] pzotov
    Confirmed problem in 6.0.0.274: some expressions fail with "SQLSTATE = 22003 / ... / -numeric value is out of range".
    Checked 6.0.0.276 -- all fine.
