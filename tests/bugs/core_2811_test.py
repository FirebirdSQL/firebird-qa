ISSUE:       1179
TITLE:       'Unsuccessful execution' error when updating a record
DESCRIPTION:
  CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER NEW_TRIGGER FOR NEW_TABLE
  ACTIVE AFTER UPDATE POSITION 20
  AS
  -- Typically this variable would be used in the trigger. To make it simple, I've
  -- removed all code possible to still get the error.
  declare variable NewHours numeric(9,2) = 0;
  BEGIN
  -- Remove the coalesce and the update will work.
  -- Remove the multiplication and the update will work.
  -- Remove this unneeded variable and the update will work.
  NewHours = coalesce(new.new_field * (0), 0);

  -- Remove this exit command and the update will work. I know it's not needed,
  -- however in the scenario I ran into this there was much more code after the
  -- exit, and the exit was inside an IF clause. This is just the simplest way of reproducing it.
  exit;
  end
  ^

  -- Now update the record to see the error:
  update new_table set new_field = 6;
