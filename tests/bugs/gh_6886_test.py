ISSUE:       6886
TITLE:       Differerent interfaces behaviour depending upon source of interface
DESCRIPTION:
  Appearance of this bug was received accidentally during implemenation of test for completely unrelated issue (gh-6935).
  First message about presence of query to RDB$AUTH_MAPPING in MON$STATEMENTS was sent to Alex, see letter 02-sep-2021 07:19.
  Only FB 4.0.1 Classic was affected. There was no problem with FB 3.x and 5.x.

  After some additional discussion it was concluded that apropriate script can serve as test for:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/11712f82039cb0318140593f433019297ae07407
    Branch: refs/heads/v4.0-release, 15.09.2021 17:41:
    "Fixed #6886: Differerent interfaces behaviour depending upon source of interface"

  Confirmed bug on 4.0.1.2592 CS (15.09.2021): got 1 record from mon$statements with following content:
    ATT_ID                          3
    ATT_USER                        SYSDBA
    SQL_TEXT_BLOB_ID                0:1
    SELECT RDB$MAP_USING, RDB$MAP_PLUGIN, RDB$MAP_DB, RDB$MAP_FROM_TYPE,  RDB$MAP_FROM, RDB$MAP_TO_TYPE, RDB$MAP_TO FROM RDB$AUTH_MAPPING
    STTM_STATE                      0
    Records affected: 1

  Checked 4.0.1.2602, 5.0.0.215 -- all OK, no records foudn in mon$statements.
