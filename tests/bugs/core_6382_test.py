ISSUE:       6621
TITLE:       Triggers accessing a table prevent concurrent DDL command from dropping that table
DESCRIPTION:
  Test creates two tables which are linked by master-detail relationship.
  We add one record into the main table and then update it with issuing further COMMIT.
  After this we try to DROP this table in another connect.

  If this connect started WAIT transaction (i.e. without lock timeout) then it can hang forever if case of
  regression of this fix. Because of this, we change its waiting mode by adding lock_timeout parameter to
  TPB and set it to 1 second.

  BEFORE fix this lead to:
    DatabaseError: / Error while commiting transaction: / - SQLCODE: -901
    - lock time-out on wait transaction / - unsuccessful metadata update
    - object TABLE "T_DETL" is in use / -901 / 335544510

  AFTER fix this DROP TABLE statement must pass without any error.
