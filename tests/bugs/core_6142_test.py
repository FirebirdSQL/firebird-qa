ISSUE:       6391
TITLE:       Error "connection lost to database" could happen when application creates few
  local attachments (using XNET) simultaneously
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses 15 threads and each of them launches loop for 10 iterations with making attach/detach from DB.
    We use Python package with name "threading" here, but it should be declared as global inside class because of fbtest specific
    (otherwise test will failed with message "global name 'threading' is not defined").
    No such declaration is needed in normal way (i.e. when running code directly from Python, w/o using fbtest).
    Each instance of worker thread has dict() for storing its ID (as a key) and pair of values (success and fail count) as value.

    We have to ensure at the final point that for every of <THREADS_CNT> threads:
    * 1) number of SUCCESSFUL attempts is equal to limit that is declared here as LOOP_CNT.
    * 2) number of FAILED attempts is ZERO.

    Confirmed bug on 4.0.0.1598, 3.0.5.33166 (checked both SS and CS).
    It was enough 3 threads (which tried to establish attachments at the same time) to get runtime error:
    "- SQLCODE: -901 / - connection lost to database".

    Checked on 4.0.0.1607, 3.0.5.33171.
    :: NB ::
    Execution time for this test strongly depends on major version and server mode:
        4.0 Classic: ~9"; 3.0.5 Classic: ~5";
        4.0 Super:   ~5"; 3.0.5 Super:   ~1".
