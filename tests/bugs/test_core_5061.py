# title:        ISQL plan output is unexpectedly truncated after a query is simplified to become shorter
# decription:   
#                  Start of discussion: letter to dimitr, 30-dec-2015 13:57; its subject refers to core-4708.
#                  It was found that explained plan produced by ISQL is unexpectedly ends on WI-V3.0.0.32256.
#                  This testuses that query, but instead of verifying plan text itself (which can be changed in the future) 
#                  it is sufficient to check only that plan does NOT contain lines with ellipsis or 'truncated' or 'error'.
#                  This mean that 'expected_stdout' section must be EMPTY. Otherwise expected_stdout will contain info 
#                  about error or invalid plan.
#
