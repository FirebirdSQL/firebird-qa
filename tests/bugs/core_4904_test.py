ISSUE:       5196
TITLE:       Index corruption when add data in long-key-indexed field
DESCRIPTION:
    In order to check ticket issues this test does following:
    1. Change on test database FW to OFF - this will increase DML performance.
    2. Create table with indexed field of length = maximum that is allowed by
       current FB implementation (page_size / 4 - 9 bytes).
    3. Try to insert enough number of records in this table - this should cause
       runtime exception SQLSTATE = 54000, "Maximum index level reached"
    4. Start validation of database: index should NOT be corrupted in its report.
JIRA:        CORE-4904
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4904
