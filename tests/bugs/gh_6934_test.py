ISSUE:       6934
TITLE:       SQL SECURITY DEFINER does not affect the ownership of created DDL objects
DESCRIPTION:
  Test invokes procedure that is declared with 'SQL SECURITY DEFINER' two times:
  1) for executing 'CREATE TABLE' statement WITHOUT specifying privileges (and current user in this case is 'SENIOR');
  2) for executing 'CREATE TABLE' *with* specifyin 'WITH CALLER PRIVILEGES' clause (and current user is 'JUNIOR').

  Then it queries to RDB$ tables in order to get info about ONWER of created tables.
  In any case owner must be 'SYSDBA' rather than 'SENIOR' or 'JUNIOR'.

  NB. Clause 'WITH CALLER PRIVILEGE' must *not* affect on result, owner will be 'SYSDBA' (as it is w/o such clause).
  This is because that clause replaces access rights of current user with rights of STORED PROCEDURE.
  Before 4.x this meaned access rights that were explicitly granted to this SP.
  But since 4.x SECURITY DEFINER set access rights of SP equal to its owner (i.e. SYSDBA).
  It means that WITH CALLER PRIVILEGES does the same, i.e. it is pointless in this case.
  Explained by dimitr, see letter 08-sep-2021 10:06.
