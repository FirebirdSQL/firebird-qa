ISSUE:       6145
TITLE:       Allow the use of management statements in PSQL blocks
DESCRIPTION:
  1. Currently test checks only ability to use SYNTAX for usage statements within PSQL blocks
     as it is described in '...\\doc\\sql.extensions\\README.management_statements_psql.md'.
     Actual affects on further work are not verified.
  2. Deferred check of 'alter session reset': got SQLSTATE = 25000/no transaction for request.
     Sent letter to dimitr et al, 09-mar-2019 13:43.
  3. Deferred check of 'SET TRUSTED ROLE': it is unclear for me how to implement this.
     Sent Q to Alex (same letter).

  All other cases are checked on 4.0.0.1421 and 4.0.0.1457: OK.
NOTES:
[10.12.2019]
  Updated syntax for SET BIND. Removed (maybe temply) check of 'set time zone bind native'.
  Commits that changed syntax:
