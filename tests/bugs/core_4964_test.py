ISSUE:       5255
JIRA:        CORE-4964
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4964
TITLE:       Real errors during connect to security database are hidden by Srp user manager. Errors should be logged no matter what AuthServer is used
DESCRIPTION:
    Test does following:
    1) creates temporary user using plugin Srp (in order to avoid occasional connect as SYSDBA using Legacy plugin);
    2) makes copy of test DB to file which is specified n databases.conf as database for alias defined by variable with name REQUIRED_ALIAS
       (its value: 'tmp_4964_alias'; test will try to connect to this file via ALIAS from pre-created databases.conf);
    3) uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias and SecurityDatabase parameter in its details.
       This parameter that points to existing file that for sure can NOT be a Firebird database
       (file $(dir_conf)/firebird.msg is used for this purpose).

    Then we:
    1) obtain content of server firebird.log;
    2) try to make connect to alias <tmp_alias> and (as expected) get error;
    3) obtain again content of server firebird.log and compare to origin one.

NOTES:
    [02.08.2022] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    3. Make sure that firebird was launched by user who is currently runs this test.
       Otherwise shutil.copy2() failes with "[Errno 13] Permission denied".
    4. Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    
    [31.07.2024] pzotov
    Replaced assert for ISQL output: added diff_patterns that must filter STDERR because we have to suppress message with text
    "file ... is not a valid database" as it can be seen only in dev-builds.
    Expected ISQL output must be compared with filtered capsys.readouterr().out rather than with act.stdout
    Noted by Dimitry Sibiryakov, https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird-qa/issues/27

    Checked on 5.0.0.591, 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - both on Windows and Linux.
