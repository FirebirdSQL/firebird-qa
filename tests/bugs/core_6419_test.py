ISSUE:       6657
TITLE:       Truncation of strings to put in MON$ tables do not work correctly
DESCRIPTION:
  We create two context variables, one consists only of ASCII characters, second contains UTF-8 character for euro currensy.
  Both variables have lenght = 90 *characters*.
  These variables are stored in mon$context_variables WITHOUT any adjusting to character set, i.e. it is NONE.
  When we query to them from mon$context_variables, output of first must be truncated to 80 *octets*.
  Output of second ALSO must be exactly 80 *octets*, but this leads to unreadable last character: not all bytes
  of 'euro' currency (which requires 3 bytes in utf-8) will be issued.

  This is considered now as EXPECTED RESULT(!), in contrary to previous one which raised exception SQLSTATE = 22001
  (string right truncation / -expected length 80, actual 90). See comments in the ticket by Adriano, 21-oct-2020 03:31 PM.

  In order to avoid Python-specific exception ('UnicodeDecodeError: utf8') we avoid to display second (utf8) variable.
  Rather, we just show its octet_length and char_length.
