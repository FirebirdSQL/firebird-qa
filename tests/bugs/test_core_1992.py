# title:        bad BLR -- invalid stream for union select
# decription:   
#                   06.02.2019. Test was refactored.
#                   CONFIRMED bug on WI-V2.5.1.26351, got:
#                       Statement failed, SQLSTATE = HY000
#                       bad BLR -- invalid stream
#                   No error since WI-V2.5.2.26540.
#                   
#                   Old version of test for this ticket used dialects 1 and 3, separately, in order to check all datatypes.
#                   This was excessive because bug was not related to dialect, thus I decided to remove old .fbt files and
#                   use new version. Beside, query for this test was adjusted for readability - added CTE instead of nested
#                   sub-queries.
#               
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   We have no care about correctness of query results here. 
#                   For this reason all rows are count'ed and we only verify that sign(count(*)) = 1, and no more checks.
#
