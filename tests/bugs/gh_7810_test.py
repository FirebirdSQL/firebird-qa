ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7810
TITLE:       Improve SKIP LOCKED implementation
DESCRIPTION:
    Test verifies ability to CHANGE records in a table which already has several locked rows by another transaction.
    Special attention is paid to COMPUTED columns: their values must present in the output which show updated/deleted data.
    Three tables are created with numeric, textual and time_zone fields. Each table contain three COMPUTED columns (e01, e02 and e03).
    Computed column 'e02' is based on 'e01', and 'e03' is based on 'e02'.
    Formulas for computed columns were choosen so that column 'e02' must have value equals to non-computed column or 'e01'.
    Test checks that value of 'e02' that is returned after update/delete must be equal to 'source' column (see 'e03' values in the output).
NOTES:
    1. Parameter ReadConsistency in firebird.conf must be set to 0, i.e. NOT-default value.
    2. TIL = "RC NO_record_version" can be used to check feature since gh-7811 was fixed (20.11.2023 in master); see 'tpb_isol_set'
    3. Here we check only UPDATE and DELETE behavior.
       Ability to run 'SELECT ... WITH LOCK' is checked in gh_7350_test.py
       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7350

    Checked on 6.0.0.150.
