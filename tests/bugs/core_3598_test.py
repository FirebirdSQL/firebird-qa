ISSUE:       3952
TITLE:       TRACE: add statistics of actions that were after transaction finished
DESCRIPTION:
  Three tables are created: permanent, GTT with on commit PRESERVE rows and on commit DELETE rows.

  Trace config is created with *prohibition* of any activity related to security<N>.fdb
  but allow to log transactions-related events (commits and rollbacks) for working database.
  Trace is started before furthe actions.

  Then we launch ISQL and apply two DML for each of these tables:
  1) insert row + commit;
  2) insert row + rollback.

  Finally (after ISQL will finish), we stop trace and parse its log.
  For *each* table TWO lines with performance statristics must exist: both for COMMIT and ROLLBACK events.
[08.02.2022] pcisar
  Fails on Windows 3.0.8 with unexpected additional output line:
    + Statement statistics detected for ROLLBACK
      Statement statistics detected for COMMIT
      Statement statistics detected for COMMIT
      Statement statistics detected for ROLLBACK
      Found performance block header
      Found table statistics for TFIX
      Statement statistics detected for COMMIT
      Statement statistics detected for ROLLBACK
      Found performance block header
      Found table statistics for GTT_SSN
      Statement statistics detected for COMMIT
      Statement statistics detected for ROLLBACK

[04.03.2022] pzotov: RESOLVED.
  Problem on Windows was caused by excessive query:
      "select current_user, current_role from rdb$database"
  -- which is done by ISQL 3.x when it gets commands from STDIN via PIPE mechanism.
  Discussed with Alex et al, since 28-feb-2022 18:05 +0300.
  Alex explanation: 28-feb-2022 19:52 +0300
