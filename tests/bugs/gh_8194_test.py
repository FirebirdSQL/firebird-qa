ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8194
TITLE:       Internal consistency check (page in use during flush) with small number of DefaultDbCachePages
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias (see variable REQUIRED_ALIAS) with DefaultDbCachePages = 128.
    Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
NOTES:
    [02.08.2024] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    3. Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    4. Custom driver config object ('db_cfg_object') is used: we have to use DB with predefined alias instead of temporary one.
    5. It is enough to set number of iterations to small number about 10...20 (see 'LOOP_LIMIT'): bugcheck raised after first 2...3 iter.

    Confirmed bug on 6.0.0.403, got in firebird.log:
        internal Firebird consistency check (page in use during flush (210), file: cch.cpp line: 2827)
    Checked on 6.0.0.406 - all fine.
