ID:          issue-7610
ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7610
TITLE:       Uninitialized/random value assigned to RDB$ROLES -> RDB$SYSTEM PRIVILEGES when restoring from FB3 backup
DESCRIPTION: 
    Test uses .fbk which was created in FB 3.x as it is described in the ticket.
    Non-privileged user 'tmp_user_7610' and role 'tmp_role_7610' are created, and their names must be exactly the same
    as used in FB 3.x.
    We restore from this DB and check that it completes OK.
    Then we make connection as non-pritileged user using role that did exist in FB 3.x.
    Query 'select rdb$role_name,rdb$system_privileges from rdb$roles' must show 0000000000000000 for this role.
    Query 'select * from test' must fail with 'no permission for SELECT' error.
NOTES:
    [03.06.2023] pzotov
    BOTH problems (ability to query table and random numbers in rdb$system_privileges) could be reproduced only in OLD
    snapshots, not in recent ones! 
    In FB 4.x last snapshot where *both* problems present is 4.0.0.2571 (20-aug-2021). In 4.0.0.2573 only problem with
    random number in rdb$ exists, but user can no longer query table.
    In 4.0.3.2948 (01-jun-2023) content of rdb$ is 0000000000000000.

    In FB 5.x situation is similar: last snapshot with *both* problems is 5.0.0.1000 (02-apr-2023), and since 5.0.0.1001
    one may see only problem with numbers in rdb$, but they look 'constant': 3400000000000000, and this is so up to 5.0.0.1063.
    Since 5.0.0.1065 (01-jun-2023) content of rdb$ is 0000000000000000.
