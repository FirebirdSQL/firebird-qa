# title:        Ability to grant role to another role
# decription:   
#                  ### NB ### This test was NOT completed! 
#                  One need to check all nuances related to granting and revoking that is issued by NON sysdba user
#                  which was granted admin option to manupulate appropriate DB objects.
#                  Also, there is not clarity about issue 08/Aug/16 06:31 AM (when user Boss2 does grant-and-revoke 
#                  sequence with some role to other user Sales but this role already was granted by _other_ user, Boss1).
#               
#                  We create two users (acnt and pdsk) and two roles for them (racnt and rpdsk).
#                  Then we create two tables (tacnt & tpdsk) and grant access on these tables for acnt & pdsk.
#                  Then we create user boss, role for him (rboss) and grant IMPLICITLY access on tables tacnt and tpdsk 
#                  to user boss via his role (rboss).
#                  Check is made to ensure that user boss HAS ability to read from both tables (being connected with role Rboss).
#                  After all, we IMPLICITLY revoke access from these tables and check again that user boss now has NO access
#                  on tables tacnt and tpdsk.
#               
#                  Checked on WI-T4.0.0.322 -- all fine.
