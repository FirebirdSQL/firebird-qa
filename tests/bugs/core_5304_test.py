ISSUE:       5581
TITLE:       Regression: Can not restore database with table contains field CHAR(n) and UTF8 character set
DESCRIPTION:
  We make initial DDL and DML using ISQL with connection charset = UTF8, and then run b/r.
  Ouput of restore is filtered so that only lines with 'ERROR' word can be displayed.
  This output should be EMPTY (i.e. no errors should occur).
