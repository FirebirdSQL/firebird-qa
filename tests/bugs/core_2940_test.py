ISSUE:       3322
TITLE:       Trace output could contain garbage data left from filtered out statements
DESCRIPTION:
[08.02.2022] pcisar
  Fails on Windows 3.0.8 with unexpected additional output line:
    + 0 records fetched
      1 records fetched
[02.03.2022] pzotov: RESOLVED.
  Problem on Windows was caused by excessive query:
      "select current_user, current_role from rdb$database"
  -- which is done by ISQL 3.x when it gets commands from STDIN via PIPE mechanism.
  Strange ZERO in "0 records" (instead of expected "1 record") can be considered as non-identified bug in trace or ISQL.
  Additional parameter in the trace config (include_filter) and using query with apropriate code (which contain required "tag")
  filters out this excessive query and trace log became identical in Windows and Linux, both for FB 3.x and 4.x

  Discussed with Alex et al, since 28-feb-2022 18:05 +0300.
  Alex explanation: 28-feb-2022 19:52 +0300
  subj: "Firebird new-QA: weird result for trivial test (outcome depends on presence of... running trace session!)"

  Checked on 3.0.8.33535, 4.0.1.2692.
