ISSUE:       5745
TITLE:       Provide ability to filter out info and warnings from trace log
DESCRIPTION:
  For FB 3.0 and above we check that trace log contains only those gdscodes which we expect.
  Also, trace should NOT contain gdscodes which we explicitly prohibit or which we do not expect
  because not empty list in 'include_gds_codes' parameter.
  Also, we verify that no more TRACE_INIT / TRACE_FINI in trace because log_initfini=false.
NOTES:
[01.04.2020]
  Up to 4.0.0.1820 (~29.03.2020, including) cursor.execute() with SELECT
  statement did NOT actually fetch record until we explicitly do futher actions, e.g:
    for r in cur:
        print(r[0])
  For this reason code which did only cur.execute('SELECT <too_long_literal_to_be_fitted> ...' )
  was useless: it did not lead to any error and trace log did NOT contain any "undesired" gdscodes
  like 335544914 or 335545033. It was exactly because of THIS rather than "good behaviour" of filter
  that we specify in the trace config (i.e. include_gdscodes or exclude_gdscodes).
  It was decided to replace selectable cursor with DML and use value that will violates limits
  of Firebird implementation (timestamp field, assign value = '01.01.0000' - it can not be used in FB).

  See letter from Vlad, 31-mar-2020 14:29.
