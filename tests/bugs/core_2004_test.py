ISSUE:       2441
TITLE:       ALTER USER XXX INACTIVE
DESCRIPTION:
  We create two users ('foo' and 'bar') and make them immediatelly INACTIVE.
  One of them has been granted with RDB$ADMIN role, so he will be able to manage of other user access.
  Then we chek then connect for one of these users (e.g., 'foo') is unable because of his inactive status.
  After this we change state of FOO to active and verify that he can make connect.
  When this user successfully establish connect, he will try to :
  * create and immediatelly drop new user ('rio');
  * change state of other existing user ('bar') to active.
  Finally, we check that user 'bar' really can connect now (after he was allowed to do this by 'foo').
NOTES:
  FB config parameters AuthClient and UserManager must contain 'Srp' plugin in their values.
