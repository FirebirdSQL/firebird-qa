ISSUE:       2311
TITLE:       Signature mismatch when creating package body on identical packaged procedure header
DESCRIPTION:
  Bug existed because backup/restore process changed value of RDB$PROCEDURE_PARAMETERS.RDB$NULL_FLAG
  for procedure parameter from NULL to 0 (zero).
  Test creates trivial package and stores its package body in variable that will be used after b/r.
  Then we do backup / restore and attempt to apply this stored package body again, see 'sql_pk_body'.

  Confirmed bug on: 4.0.0.1766,  3.0.6.33247. Attempt to apply 'recreate package ...' with the same SQL code fails with:
    Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 42000 / ... / -Procedure ... has a signature mismatch on package body ...
  Bug was partially fixed in snapshots 4.0.0.1782 and 3.0.6.33252: problem remained if procedure parameter was of built-in
  datatype rather than domain (i.e. this parameter type was TIMESTAMP or INT etc, instead of apropriate domain).

  Completely fixed in snapshots 4.0.0.1783 and 3.0.6.33254 (checked 23.02.2020).
  Added special check for parameter that is declared of built-in datatype rather than domain.
