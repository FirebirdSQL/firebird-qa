ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/7853
TITLE:       Do not consider non-deterministic expressions as invariants in pre-filters
DESCRIPTION:
    Change in FB 5.x was pushed 14.12.2023 20:06:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/f0b7429a1873ed9470838da61bdca0bce748652d
    Functions gen_id(), rand(), gen_uuid(), rdb$set_context and some other are not considered as deterministic anymore.
    It means that explained plans for queries which used these functions will change: now they must NOT contain 'Filter (preliminary)'.
    This behavior changed since snapshot 5.0.0.1304 (date: 16-dec-2023).
NOTES:
    [17.12.2023] pzotov
    1. Explained plans for queries where 'tmain' have aliases 'm0'  ... 'm4' have:
       * 'Filter (preliminary)' - for snapshots before this fix
       * 'Filter' (WITHOUT preliminary) - after fix
    2. Last commit in the push is "deterministic uncorrelated subqueries to be considered as invariants" - but there is NO DIFFERENCE
       between explained plans for 5.x snapshots that belongs to time points just _before_ and _after_ this push.
       This is because push of PR#7853 has several commits, and one of them did broke such functionality whereas next
       commit - WITHIN THIS PUSH (!) - did restore previous state (letter by dimitr, 17.12.2023 21:17).

    3. Actually, NON-correlated subqueries became considered as INVARIANT much earlier, since 5.0.0.890, 10-jan-2023
       ("Merge pull request #7441 from FirebirdSQL/v5-pretty-explained-plan", a6ce0ec1632ec037b41b9cbcad42fd3ce6a9ea5e).
       It seems that this old commit (of 10-jan-2023) caused lot of old issues to be considered now as fixed, for example 
       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/3394
       Query where 'tmain' table has alias 'm4' (and 'tdetl' table is involved - in contrary to all other queries) - is from this ticket.
       This query explained plan must have "Sub-query (invariant)" since build 5.0.0.890

    Checked on 5.0.0.1304
    ::: NB ::: Build 6.0.0.180 - FAILS because this PR still not pushed in master branch. Waiting for commit.

    Remove upper bound for version after this feature was front-ported to 6.x in commit 0d72b8097c292dabb5c9a257a157f20d9362ab26 (16.11.23).
    Checked on 6.0.0.532.
