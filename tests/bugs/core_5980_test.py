# title:        Firebird crashes due to concurrent operations with expression indices
# decription:   
#                   Scenario for reproducing was given by Vlad, letter 25-02-2020 19:15.
#                   Unfortuinately, this crash can occur only in developer build rather than release one.
#               
#                   Although issues from ticket can NOT be reproduced, it was encountered in 2.5.0.26074
#                   that statements from here lead DB to be corrupted:
#                       Error while commiting transaction:
#                       - SQLCODE: -902
#                       - database file appears corrupt...
#                       - wrong page type
#                       - page 0 is of wrong type (expected 6, found 1)
#                       -902
#                       335544335
#                  No such problem in 2.5.1 and above.
#                  Decided to add this .fbt just for check that DB will not be corrupted.
#               
#                  TICKET ISSUE REMAINS IRREPRODUCIBLE (checked on following SuperServer builds: 2.5.1, 2.5.6, 2.5.9, 3.0.6, 4.0.0).
