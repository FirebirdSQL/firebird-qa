ISSUE:       6726
TITLE:       string_to_datetime and '\\0' symbol
DESCRIPTION:
  ascii_char(0) was allowed to be concatenated with string and pass then to cast(... as timestamp)
  up to 4.0.0.1227 (29-09-2018), and is forbidden since 4.0.0.1346 (17.12.2018).
  FB 3.x allows this character to be used and issues timestamp instead of error.
JIRA:        CORE-6496
