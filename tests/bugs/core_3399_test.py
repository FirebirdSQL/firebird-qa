    -- ======= from the ticket: ========
    -- Implementation allows:
    -- 1) writes into all kind of GTT's in read only transactions in read write database
    -- and also
    -- 2) make writabe GTT ON COMMIT DELETE in read only transactions in read only database.
    -- =================================
    -- Database will be in the state "force write, no reserve, read only".
    -- This test verifies only SECOND issue from ticket: allow GTT with attribute "on commit DELETE rows"
    -- to be writeable when database is READ-ONLY.
