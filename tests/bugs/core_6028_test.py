ISSUE:       6278
TITLE:       Trigger on system table restored in FB3 database and can't be deleted
DESCRIPTION:
  We restore here database that was created in FB 2.5.9 and contained triggers for tables RDB$RELATION_FIELDS, MON$STATEMENTS and MON$ATTACHMENTS.
  Table RDB$RELATION_FIELDS had triggers BEFORE INSERT and AFTER INSERT. Monitoring tabled had triggers BEFORE DELETE and AFTER DELETE.
  Also, table 'TLOG' is in this database, and this table serves as log for actions: create/drop table; delete from mon$statements and delete from mon$attachments.
  For DDL like 'create table test(x int)' and 'drop table test' table TLOG will contain two records which are added there by triggers on RDB$RELATION_FIELDS.
  Further, if we create addition connection and run statement which returns at least one record (like 'select ... from rdb$database') then in 2.5 two recors
  had been added into TLOG for each of: 'DELETE FROM MON$STATEMENTS' and 'DELETE FROM MON$ATTACHMENTS'.

  Finally, BEFORE fix of this ticket issue (e.g. in WI-V3.0.5.33109):
  1) restored database contained following triggers: TRG_MON_ATTACHMENTS*, TRG_MON_STATEMENTS* and TRG_RDB_REL_FIELDS*
  2) statements 'create table' and 'drop table' led to logging following records in TLOG:
      rdb$relation_fields: record is to be created
      rdb$relation_fields: record has been created
      rdb$relation_fields: record is to be removed
      rdb$relation_fields: record has been removed
  3) command 'delete from mon$statement' (when there was another non-system connection with one running or completed statement)
     led to logging these records in TLOG:
       mon$statements: record is to be removed
       mon$statements: record has been removed
  4) command 'delete from mon$attachments' (when there was another non-system connection) led to logging these records in TLOG:
      mon$attachments: record is to be removed
      mon$attachments: record has been removed

  All of above mentioned should NOT appear in a database that is restored AFTER this ticket was fixed.
  Finally, we try to create three new triggers for tables rdb$relation-fields, mon$statements and mon$attachments.
  All of these attempts must FAIL with:
  ========
    - no permission for ALTER access to TABLE RDB$RELATION_FIELDS
    -607
