ISSUE:       6056
TITLE:       Error returned from DbCryptPlugin::setKey() is not shown
DESCRIPTION:
    Test database that is created by fbtest framework will be encrypted here using IBSurgeon Demo Encryption package
    ( https://ib-aid.com/download-demo-firebird-encryption-plugin/ ; https://ib-aid.com/download/crypt/CryptTest.zip )
    License file plugins\\dbcrypt.conf with unlimited expiration was provided by IBSurgeon to Firebird Foundation (FF).
    This file was preliminary stored in FF Test machine.
    Test assumes that this file and all neccessary libraries already were stored into FB_HOME and %FB_HOME%\\plugins.

    First, we try to encrypt DB with existing key and decrypt it aftee this - just to ensure that this mechanism works fine.
    Then we use statement 'alter database encrypt ...' with NON existing key and check parts of exception that will raise.
    From these three parts (multi-string, int and bigint numbers) we check that 1st contains phrase about missed crypt key.
    ::: NOTE ::::
    Text of messages differ in 3.0.5 vs 4.0.0:
        3.0.5: - Missing correct crypt key
        4.0.0: - Missing database encryption key for your attachment
    - so we use regexp tool for check pattern matching.
    Because of different text related to missing plugin, this part is replaced with phrase:
    <FOUND PATTERN-1 ABOUT MISSED ENCRYPTION KEY> -- both for 3.0.x  and 4.0.x.

    Confirmed difference in error message (text decription, w/o sqlcode and gdscode):
    1) 3.0.3.32900
    =====
        Error while executing SQL statement:
        - SQLCODE: -607
        - unsuccessful metadata update
        - ALTER DATABASE failed
        - Missing correct crypt key
    =====

    2) 3.0.5.33139 - two lines were added:
    ====
        - Plugin KeyHolder:
        - Unknown key name FOO - key can't be found in KeyHolder.conf
    ====

    Checked on:
        4.0.0.1524: OK, 4.674s.
        3.0.5.33139: OK, 3.666s.

    15.04.2021. Adapted for run both on Windows and Linux. Checked on:
      Windows: 4.0.0.2416
      Linux:   4.0.0.2416
