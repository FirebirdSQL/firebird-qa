ISSUE:       6339
TITLE:       BLOBs are unnecessarily copied during UPDATE after a table format change
DESCRIPTION:
  It's not easy to obtain BLOB_ID using only fdb. Rather in ISQL blob_id will be shown always (even if we do not want this :)).
  This test runs ISQL with commands that were provided in the ticket and parses its result by extracting only column BLOB_ID.
  Each BLOB_ID is added to set(), so eventually we can get total number of UNIQUE blob IDs that were generated during test.
  This number must be equal to number of records in the table (three in this test).
