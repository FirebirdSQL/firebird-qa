ISSUE:       5939
TITLE:       Unique constraint not working in encrypted database on first command
DESCRIPTION:
    We create new database ('tmp_core_5673.fdb') and try to encrypt it using IBSurgeon Demo Encryption package
    ( https://ib-aid.com/download-demo-firebird-encryption-plugin/ ; https://ib-aid.com/download/crypt/CryptTest.zip )
    License file plugins\\dbcrypt.conf with unlimited expiration was provided by IBSurgeon to Firebird Foundation (FF).
    This file was preliminary stored in FF Test machine.
    Test assumes that this file and all neccessary libraries already were stored into FB_HOME and %FB_HOME%\\plugins.

    We create table with UNIQUE constraint, add some data to it and try to encrypt database using 'alter database encrypt with <plugin_name> ...'
    command (where <plugin_name> = dbcrypt - name of .dll in FB_HOME\\plugins\\  folder that implements encryption).
    Then we allow engine to complete this job - take delay about 1..2 seconds BEFORE detach from database.

    After this we make TWO attempts to insert duplicates and catch exceptions for each of them and print exception details.
    Expected result: TWO exception must occur here.

    ::: NB ::::
    Could not check reproducing of bug on FB 3.0.2 because there is no encryption plugin for this (too old) version.
    Decided only to ensure that exception will be catched on recent FB version for each attempt to insert duplicate.
    Checked on:
         4.0.0.1524: OK, 4.056s ;  4.0.0.1421: OK, 6.160s.
        3.0.5.33139: OK, 2.895s ; 3.0.5.33118: OK, 2.837s.

    15.04.2021. Adapted for run both on Windows and Linux. Checked on:
      Windows: 4.0.0.2416
      Linux:   4.0.0.2416

#  # can not be used for such value of client dialect.
#  # One need to to use only cursor_obj.execute() for encryption!
