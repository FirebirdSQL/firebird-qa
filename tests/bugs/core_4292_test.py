# title:        Server ignores asynchronous (monitoring or cancellation) requests while preparing a query with lot of windowed functions
# decription:
#                   Preparing stage of test query will last lot of time even on power host.
#                   We launch separate (child) process with ISQL and allow him to start preparing this query during several
#                   seconds. Then we launch second child process with ISQL and try to kill first one.
#                   Before this ticket was fixed it was NOT possible neither to cancel it by using MON$ATTACHMENTS nor even
#                   query MON$ tables at all (until this 'complex query' preparing finish).
#
#                   Checked on WI-V3.0.0.32081, SS / SC / CS. Result: all fine.
#                   11.05.2017: checked on WI-T4.0.0.638 - added filtering to messages about shutdown state, see comments below.
