# title:        Srp user manager sporadically creates users which can not attach
# decription:   
#                   Explanation of bug nature was provided by Alex, see letter 05-jun-19 13:51.
#                   Some iteration failed with probability equal to occurence of 0 (zero) in the
#                   highest BYTE of some number. Byte is 8 bit ==> this probability is 1/256.
#                   Given 'N_LIMIT' is number of iterations, probability of success for ALL of
#                   them is 7.5%, and when N_LIMIT is 1000 then p = 0.004%.
#                   Because of time (speed) it was decided to run only 256 iterations. If bug
#                   will be 'raised' somewhere then this number is enough to catch it after 2-3
#                   times of test run.
#               
#                   Reproduced on WI-V3.0.5.33118, date: 11-apr-19 (got fails not late than on 250th iteration).
#                   Works fine on WI-V3.0.5.33139, date: 04-apr-19.
#               
#                   :::NOTE:::
#                   A new bug was found during this test implementation, affected 4.0 Classic only: CORE-6080.
#               
#                   Checked on:
#                       3.0.5.33140, SS: OK, 14.864s.
#                       4.0.0.1530,  SS: OK, 22.478s.
#                       4.0.0.1530,  Cs: OK, 39.576s. -- NB: Classic mode failed until core-6080 was fixed
