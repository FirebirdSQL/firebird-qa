ISSUE:       5912
TITLE:       Parse error when compiling a statement causes memory leak until attachment is disconnected
DESCRIPTION:
  Test uses DDL and query for well known Einstein task.
  Code of SQL was included inside SP and will be compiled on dynamic basis (using ES mechanism).
  Syntax error was intentionally added into this code, so actually it will not ever run.
  After each call of this SP we have to query mon$ tables in order to detect memory leak, but we have to do this
  TWO times together (and i don't know why it is so).
  Every even run (2nd, 4th,6 th etc) of this query gave memory leak about ~7...9% in previous version.

  We repeat in loop of 60 iterations attempt to run SP and then twice query mon$ tables and add results into log.
  Finally, we check that difference in max_memory* fields is ZERO, or (at least) there can be only one difference more
  than threshold. After lot of runs this threshold was set to 1.00 (percent) -- see query below.
JIRA:        CORE-5646
FBTEST:      bugs.core_5646
NOTES:
    [26.11.2023]
    This test was commited 24-dec-2018 after discussion with dimitr.
    According to my reports, problem reproduced on build 4.0.800 (15-nov-2017) and seemed fixed on build 4.0.0.834 (21-dec-2017).
    But since 6.0.0.97 (28-oct-2023) this test fails on every run for FB 6.x, and this occurs on Linux and Windows-10 (no such problem on Windows-8.1).

    Despite fact that problem could be reproduced in dec-2018, i can not understand how this could be so!
    Because commits in 2017 were only in the branch 'nodes-memory-core-5611':
        22-oct-2017: refs/heads/work/nodes-memory-core-5611 // Better handling for the scratch pool and fixed CORE-5646.
        26-nov-2017: refs/heads/work/nodes-memory-core-5611 // Correction - thanks to Dmitry.
        27-nov-2017: refs/heads/work/nodes-memory-core-5611 // Better handling for the scratch pool and fixed CORE-5646.

    Final commit to refs/heads/B3_0_Release waw only 15-JUN-2021:
