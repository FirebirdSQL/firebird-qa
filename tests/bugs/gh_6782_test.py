ISSUE:       6782
TITLE:       Getting "records fetched" for functions/procedures in trace
DESCRIPTION:
    Confirmed bug on 4.0.0.2436, there was no:
      * lines with number of fetched rows;
      * additional info about number of fetches/reads/writes/marks (after elapsed time).

    In other words, trace log:
    * was before fix:
      Procedure <some_name>
            0 ms
    * became after fix:
      Procedure <some_name>
      5 records fetched    <<< --- added
            0 ms, 10 fetch(es)
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ --- added

    Test parses trace log and search there lines with names of known procedures/functions and
    then checks presence of lines with number of fetched records (for selectable procedures) and
    additional statistics ('fetches/reads/writes/marks').
NOTES:
    [30.06.2022] pzotov
    Checked on 3.0.8.33535, 4.0.1.2692, 5.0.0.509.
