ISSUE:       5183
TITLE:       FBSVCMGR with `action_trace_start` prevents in 3.0 SuperServer from connecting using local protocol
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
  This test fails on Windows with "FAILED to find text in trace related to EMBEDDED connect."

[08.03.2022] pzotov
  Fail on Windows caused by 'select current_user from rdb$database' which issues '0 records' (instead of expected '1 records')
  But there is no much sence to search this line ('... records fetched') because it is enough to detect only lines with
  ATTACH and DETACH that were performed by embedded connect. Replaced code which did trace log parsing.
