ISSUE:       3017
TITLE:       Introducer (_charset) problems with monitoring and persistent modules
DESCRIPTION:
  Usage of introducer (_charset ) is problematic due to usage of different character sets
  in a single command. The problems are different from version to version, and may be
  transliteration error, malformed string or just unexpected things.
JIRA:        CORE-2607
