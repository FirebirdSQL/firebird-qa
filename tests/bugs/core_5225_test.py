ISSUE:       5505
TITLE:       Authentication end with first plugin that has the user but auth fails; should continue with next plugin
DESCRIPTION:
  We create two users with the same name, 1st using plugin Srp, 2nd - via Legacy.
  Then we try to establish subsequent attachments via ES/EDS for each of them.
  No error should occur.
