ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8255
TITLE:       Catch possible stack overflow when preparing and compiling user statements
DESCRIPTION:
    Test generates SQL like 'select 1+1+1....+1 from rdb$database' and tries to execte it.
    Exception 'SQLSTATE = HY001 / Stack overflow' must raise instead of crash (that was before fix).

NOTES:
    [23.09.2024] pzotov
    Initially query containing 15'000 terms in "+1+1...+1" expression used to check.
    This query causes 'stack overflow' only in FB 5.x and 6.x.
    But in FB 4.0.6.3156 it successfully COMPLETES calculation and issues result.
    For FB 4.x this 'threshold' is 16'287 (last number of terms where FB can evaluate result w/o 'stack overflow').
    Because of this, it was decided to increase number of terms to 50'000.

    Checked on 6.0.0.466, 5.0.2.1513, 4.0.6.3156
