ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/5160
TITLE:       CREATE DATABASE fail with ISQL
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias (see variable REQUIRED_ALIAS) and SecurityDatabase in its details
    which points to that alias, thus making such database be self-security.
    Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
    
    Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
    (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)

    We connect to currently used test DB (which is created by QA plugin) via local protocol, using appropriate
    'CONNECT' command in the SQL script.
    Then we attempt to create new database using command which was providd in the ticket (only page_size was increased to recent).
    After this, we create user in this (new) database and ensure that this DB has owner = current OS user, is self-security etc.
    Finally, we drop new DB and make connect to 'previous' DB which was created by QA plugin, and check that there is NO user
    which was created in the self-security (just dropped) DB.

JIRA:        CORE-4864
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4864
NOTES:
    [04.08.2022] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    3. Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    4. It is crucial to be sure that current OS environment has no ISC_USER and ISC_PASSWORD variables. Test forcibly unsets them.

    Checked on 5.0.0.591, 4.0.1.2692, 3.0.8.33535 - both on Windows and Linux.
