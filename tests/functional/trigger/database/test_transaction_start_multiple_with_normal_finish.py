# title:        Multiple triggers on start transaction
# decription:   
#                   This tests normal operation of database TRANSACTION START trigger when:
#                   1) more than one such triggers are defined
#                   2) NO exception raise within any trigger during its work, i.e. all of them shoudl finish Ok
#               
#                   Triggers must work within the same Tx as "parent" statement (which launched this Tx).
