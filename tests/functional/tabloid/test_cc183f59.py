ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/cc183f599ee09233d6da294893f651de0ab76136
TITLE:       Add key info to the merge join plan output
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    MERGE JOIN will be chosen by optimizer when several conditions are met:
    * data sources are joined by INNER join;
    * data sources are ORDERED, BUT *NOT* via GROUP BY (because optimizer tends to think about grouped data
      that its cardinality *much* less than cardinality of source and it causes to decide using hash join instead).
      This was explained by dimitr privately, letter: 24-sep-2024 16:30.
    * number of conflicts in the hash table must be above 1009 * 1000 = 1009000.
      Experimental shows that minimal threshold for switching from HJ to MJ is 1009883 rows.
      This value must NOT depend on machine but can have limited dependency on page_size
      (see letter from dimitr, 24-sep-2024 19:09).
    * No ticket has been created for this test.

    Checked on 6.0.0.467.
