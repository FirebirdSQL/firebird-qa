# title:        Check ability of outer join simplification.
# decription:   
#                  We can replace 'A left join B' with 'A inner join B' if:
#                  1. Both of these datasources are referred later in the expression of INNER join with some else datasource, and
#                  2. There are no disjunction in this expression, i.e. its parts aren't linked by "OR", and
#                  3. Each part of this expression is null-rejected.
