# title:        Check ability of outer join simplification.
# decription:   
#                  From join-transformation-008.fbt:
#                  ===
#                  For two sources, S and T, which:
#                  1) are separated by at least one "intermediate" source G (e.g. which is just "after" S and is "before" T), and 
#                  2) are involved into left join predicate P(S,T) which does not participate in disjunction ("OR"ed) expression
#                  -- one may to replace all LEFT joins starting from G and up to T with INNER ones.
#                  Join condition between S and its adjacent datasource (G) should be preserved as it is in original query.
#                  ===
#                  Additional case here: when a query has several predicates {P1, P2,..., Pn} that involves non-adjacent datasources 
#                  and are null-rejected then we can replace left-outer joins with inner ones separately for each of {P1, P2,..., Pn}.
#                  Moreover, if some pair of them (say, Px and Py) have common "affecting area" (affects on the same datasources) then
#                  result of replacement for Px can be preserved even if some of aliases (affected by Px) are starting pair for Py
#                  (which could NOT be replaced if query would have only one Py) - this effect looks like "bin_or".

            -- Here we have two predicates that "jumps" over more than one datasource,
            -- i.e. they involve relations which are NOT adjacent in the query.
            -- Hereafter such predicates are called "jumpers".
            -- First such predicate is "a.z = d.x" - it involve relations A & D and 
            -- its affecting area is marked below as "::::::::::::::".
            -- Second is "b.w = e.y" - it involve relations B &E and its affecting area
            -- is marked as "%%%%%%%%%%%%%".
            -- Note that these areas are crossed, i.e. they have common portion:
            --      a       b       c       d       e

            --
            -- Note also that relation F is not affected by these predicates.
            -- Because all expressions are null-rejected, we can replace LEFT joins with INNER ones
            -- in the following places:
            -- 1) for predicate "a.z=d.x" - starting from 'b left join c' and up to 'c left join d';
            -- 2) for predicate "b.w=e.y" - starting from 'c left join d' and up to 'd left join d'.
            -- If 2nd predicate would be single that "jumps" over several datasources, then we could
            -- NOT to change 'b left join c' with inner. But we DO this when handle 1st "jumper", and
            -- this replacement (will be made for "a.z=d.x") is NOT discarded: this looks like "bin_or"
            -- result. In other words, if some LEFT_JOIN could be replaced with INNER one because of
            -- "jumping" predicate, this result shoudl be preserved during handling of further "jumpers".
