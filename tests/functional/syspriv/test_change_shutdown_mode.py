ID:          syspriv.change-shutdown-mode
TITLE:       Check ability to change database shutdown mode by non-sysdba user who is
  granted with necessary system privileges
DESCRIPTION:
    Test creates common user and role, then it grants system privileged to that role
    and, in turn, grants role to user. Because role is granted as DEFAULT, we can connect
    to services without specifying it.
    Further, we change DB state to shutdown and bring it online several times, using this
    non-DBA user account. All these actions must not raise exception.
    NB: role must be granted with 'IGNORE_DB_TRIGGERS' privilege in order to bypass DB-level
    triggers when user is attaching to DB which has such triggers. Test verifies this by adding
    table which is filled by DB-level trigger on connect. This table must remain EMPTY at the
    final point of the test, see 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ATT_LOG' query.

FBTEST:      functional.syspriv.change_shutdown_mode
NOTES:
    [20.05.2022] pzotov
    In order to verify ability to change DB state to SINGLE or MULTI, one need to grant system privilege
    ACCESS_SHUTDOWN_DATABASE, oterwise attempt to change DB state to such mode will fail with error:
    "database ... shutdown".

    Checked on 4.0.1.2692, 5.0.0.497.
