ID:          replication.bugcheck_in_rw_replica_after_conflicting_insert
ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8040
TITLE:       Bugcheck 183 (wrong record length) could happen on replica database after UK violation on insert
DESCRIPTION:
    Test temporary changes mode of replica to READ-WRITE.

    We create table 'PERF_AGG' on master with PK-column and UNIQUE constraint for other several columns (<S>)
    After this we wait until replica becomes actual to master, and this delay will last no more then threshold that
    is defined by MAX_TIME_FOR_WAIT_DATA_IN_REPLICA variable (measured in seconds), see QA_ROOT/files/test_config.ini

    Then we change mode of replica to *READ-WRITE* and add record in its 'PERF_AGG' table.
    After this, we add record in master 'PERF_AGG' with same values in <S> (but value in PK differs from replica one).
    This causes violation of UNIQUE index in replica DB but no error must raise (UPDATE should be with warning).
    We monintor replication.log until appropriate message appear in it.

NOTES:
    [14.03.2024] pzotov
    ::: ACHTUNG :::
    If test runs against FB service then make sure that its recovery option does NOT set to 'Restart'!
    Otherwise every FB restart will cause bugcheck at first connection to replica DB with infinite restarts.

    Added temporary mark 'disabled_in_forks' to SKIP this test when QA runs agains *fork* of standard FB.
    Reason: infinite bugchecks and possible disk overflow if dumps creation enabled.
    Confirmed problem and bugcheck on:
        6.0.0.286 (12.03.2024), 5.0.1.1358 (13.03.2024), 4.0.5.3066  (regular sapshot, date: 13.03.2024):
        E firebird.driver.types.DatabaseError: Unable to complete network request to host "localhost".
        E -Failed to establish a connection.
    Checked on Windows:
        6.0.0.288 eee5704, 5.0.1.1360 055b53b, 4.0.5.3077 (regular sapshot, date: 14.03.2024)

    [26.03.2024] pzotov
    1. BEFORE 6.0.0.293 (commit #62f4c5a7, "Improvement #8042 : Improve conflict resolution...") we had to wait until
       message "ERROR: attempt to store duplicate value" will appear TWO times (it proved that there was no bugcheck).
       SINCE 6.0.0.293 error does not raise. Rather, such data (with duplicated values for unique index) will cause
       "Record being inserted ... already exists, updating instead".

    2. Before commit #62f4c5a7 (fixed #8042), replication was no longer viable at the end of this test. Because of this,
       we could not call drop_db_objects() function on master with assumption that changes will be transferred to replica.
       This caused implementation of 'special version' of reset_replication() function: it immediately changes DB state
       to 'full shutdown' for both databases and drop them.
       Although this function can be replaced now to its 'usual' version (see another tests), I've decided to keep
       its previous code (i.e. to keep the way it is).

    Checked on 6.0.0.299 b1ba859 (SS/CS).
    Checked on 4.0.5.3112-d2e612c, 5.0.1.1416-b4b3559, 6.0.0.374-0097d28
