#                   ATTENTION! CURRENT FB INSTANCE DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS TEST WORK! TEMPORARY INSTANCE IS USED!
#                   RESULT OF THIS TEST HAS NO "LINK: WITH CURRENTLY CHECKED FB SERVERMODE! DIFF OUTPUT MUST BE CHECKED!

#               
#                   Basic check of External Connections Pool. We verify here following:
#                   * ability to reuse connections from ECP in case running ES/EDS by "frequent" attachments
#                   * ability to distinguish connect/disconnect from reuse connections within apropriate
#                     DB-level trigger (system variable RESETTING = faluse | true)
#                   * ability to get information about ECP state: total number of active and idle connections.
#               
#                   See $FB_HOME/doc/sql.extensions/README.external_connections_pool and CORE-5832.
#                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                   Test retrieves FB_HOME directory and makes copy of firebird.conf and database.conf files.
#                   Then it searches for free TCP port and overwrites content of firebird.conf: this new port 
#                   will be specified for RemoveServicePort (see 'TMP_FREE_PORT').
#                   Also, parameters for working with External Connections Pool (hereafter: ECP) will be added:
#                       ExtConnPoolSize  = <not less than 5>
#                       ExtConnPoolLifeTime = <ECP_LIFE>
#                   -- where <ECP_LIFE> can be set to 5...10 s (but not less than 3).
#               
#                   New alias is added to databases.conf for test .fdb which must be created as self-security DB:
#                       tmp_ecp_01 = <test_fdb> {
#                           SecurityDatabase = tmp_ecp_01
#                           RemoteAccess = true
#                       }
#                   File $FB_HOME/securityN.fdb is copied to the <test_fdb>.
#               
#                   After this test launches new Firebird instance *as application* (see async. call of Popen()) and make
#                   some actions with just created test DB (alias = tmp_ecp_01). Because this DB is self-secutity, we can
#                   use it for connect without any conflict with existing FB instance.
#               
#                   When all needed actions with this DB complete, this FB temporary instance will be stopped.
#                   Test does start and stop of this FB instance _two_ times because of checking following ServerMode:
#                   * Super
#                   * SuperClassic
#                   
#                   ::: NOTE :::
#                   Test does NOT check Servermode = Classic because of unpredictable results when ExtConnPoolLifeTime less than 7s.
#                   In some cases number of IDLE connections can differ from one run to another. The reason is remaining unknown.
#                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                   After FB instance launch, test runs ISQL that connects to <test_fdb> using port <TMP_FREE_PORT> and creates
#                   several DB objects:
#                       * DB-level triggers on CONNECT / DISCONNECT;
#                       * table 'audit' for logging these events, with specifying detailed info: whether current
#                         connect/disconnect is caused by SESSION RESET (variable RESETTING is TRUE) or no;
#                       * two users who which further perform connect and run several ES/EDS statements:
#                           'freq' -- will do ES/EDS 'frequently', i.e. with interval LESS than ExtConnPoolLifeTime;
#                           'rare' -- will do ES/EDS 'rarely', with interval GREATER than ExtConnPoolLifeTime;
#                       * role 'cleaner_ext_pool' with granting to it system privilege MODIFY_EXT_CONN_POOL, in order
#                         to have ability to clear ext pool after final ES/EDS. Grant this role to both 'freq' and 'rare'
#                   
#                   Then we create several connections for user 'freq' (appending them into a list) and for each of them
#                   do ES/EDS. Number of connections is specified by variable ITER_LOOP_CNT. Delay between subsequent
#                   ES/EDS for 'freq' is minimal: 1 second.
#                   After this, we repeate the same for user 'rare', and use delay between subsequent ES/EDS GREATER
#                   than ExtConnPoolLifeTime for <ADD_DELAY_FOR_RARE> seconds.
#                   After loop we clear ExtConnPool and close all connections from list.
#                   
#                   Finally test terminates Firebird application process and queries to the table 'audit' for check results.
#                   Number of rows (and unique connection IDs) for user 'freq' must be significantly less than for user 'rare',
#                   despite the fact that both of them did the same work. This is because engine held idle connections in the pool
#                   and user FREQ could re-use them when ran subsequent ES/EDS.
#               
#                   ::: CAUTION :::
#                   Windows Firewall can block attempt to launch FB as application (dialog window appears in this case).
#                   One may need to configure Firewall so that process <FB_HOME>
#               irebird.exe is enable to operate on any port.
#               
#                   Perhaps, following command will be useful: netsh advfirewall set privateprofile state off
#               
#                   Checked on 4.0.0.2235, FB instances were launched as 'Super' and 'SuperClassic'. Time: ~52s.
#               
#                   22.05.2021: definition of full path and name to security.db was wrong because it supposed that FB major version
#                   corresponds to numeric suffix of security database (FB 3.x --> security3.fdb; FB 4.x --> security4.fdb).
#                   But in major version FB 5.x currently remains to use security4.fdb.
#                   Proper way is either to use Services API (call to get_security_database_path()) or get this info from fbtest
#                   built-in context variable context['isc4_path'].
#                   Checked on 5.0.0.47 (Linux, Windows).
