TITLE:       Check list of files in the current Firebird snapshot
DESCRIPTION:
  Get list of all files from FB_HOME and compare it with expected for each major FB version.
  Test will allert about files which existed before and now are missed.
  Test will NOT alert if new files was added to FB distributive by developers.
  In such case we have to adjust expected list manually (see variable 'check_set').

  Idea about this test originates to CORE-6424 (missed employee.fdb in some intermediate build),
  but it seems that there were several other tickets about the same (missing some of necessary files).
