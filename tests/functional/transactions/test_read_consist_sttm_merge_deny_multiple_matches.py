TITLE:       READ CONSISTENCY. MERGE must reject multiple matches, regardless on statement-level restart.
DESCRIPTION:
  Initial article for reading:
      https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:::::P11_QUESTION_ID:11504247549852
      Note on terms which are used there: "BLOCKER", "LONG" and "FIRSTLAST" - their names are slightly changed here
      to: LOCKER-1, WORKER and LOCKER-2 respectively.

      See also: doc/README.read_consistency.md
      Letter from Vlad: 15.09.2020 20:04 // subj "read consistency // addi test(s)"

      ::: NB :::
      This test uses script %FBT_REPO%/files/read-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
      Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
      results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
      outcome of test.

      Test verifies DENIAL of multiple matches when MERGE encounteres them, but this statement works in read committed read consistency TIL
      and forced to do several statement-level restarts before such condition will occur.

      Scenario:
      * add initial data to the table TEST: six rows with ID and X = (0, ..., 5);
      * launch LOCKER-1 and catch record with ID = 0: update, then commit and once again update this record (without commit);
      * launch WORKER which tries to do:
            merge into test t
                using (
                    select s.id, s.x from test as s
                    where s.id <= 1
                    order by s.id DESC
                ) s
                on abs(t.id) = abs(s.id)
            when matched then
                update set t.x = t.x * s.x
            ;
        This statement will update record with ID = 1 but then hanging because rows with ID = 0 is locked by LOCKER-1.
        At this point WORKER changes its TIL to RC NO RECORD_VERSION. This allows WORKER to see all records which will be committed later;
        NOTE: records with ID = 2...5 will not be subect for this statement (because they will not returned by data source marked as 's').

      * LOCKER-2 updates row with ID = 5 by reverting sign of this field (i.e. set ID to -5), then issues commit and updates this row again (without commit);
      * LOCKER-1 updates row with ID = 4 and set ID to -4, then issues commit and updates this row again (without commit);
      * LOCKER-2 updates row with ID = 3 and set ID to -3, then issues commit and updates this row again (without commit);
      * LOCKER-1 updates row with ID = 2 and set ID to -2, then issues commit and updates this row again (without commit);
      * LOCKER-2 inserts row (ID,X) = (-1, 1), commit and updates this row again (without commit);
      * LOCKER-1 issues commit;
      * LOCKER-2 issues commit;

      Each of updates/inserts which are performed by LOCKERs lead to new record be appeared in the data source 's' of MERGE statement.
      But note that last statement: insert into test(id,x) values(-1,1) -- creates record that will match TWISE when ON-expression of MERGE
      will evaluates "abs(t.id) = abs(s.id)": first match will be found for record with ID = +1 and second - for newly added rows with ID=-1.

      At this point MERGE must fail with message
          Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 21000
          Multiple source records cannot match the same target during MERGE

      All changes that was performed by MERGE must be rolled back.
      ISQL which did MERGE must issue "Records affected: 2" because MERGE was actually could process records with ID = 1 and 0 (and failed on row with ID=-1).

      Above mentioned actions are performed two times: first for TABLE and second for naturally-updatable VIEW (v_test), see 'target_object_type'.

        1. Added trace launch and its parsing in order to get number of times when WORKER statement did restart.
           See commits:
           1) FB 4.x (23-JUN-2022, 4.0.2.2782): https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/95b8623adbf129d0730a50a18b4f1cf9976ac35c
           2) FB 5.x (27-JUN-2022, 5.0.0.555):  https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/f121cd4a6b40b1639f560c6c38a057c4e68bb3df

           Trace must contain several groups, each with similar lines:
               <timestamp> (<trace_memory_address>) EXECUTE_STATEMENT_RESTART
               {SQL_TO_BE_RESTARTED}
               Restarted <N> time(s)

        2. To prevent raises between concurrent transactions, it is necessary to ensure that code:
               * does not allow LOCKER-2 to start its work until WORKER session will establish connection and - moreover - will actually locks first record 
                 from the scope that is seen by the query that we want to be executed by worker.
               * does not allow LOCKER-1 to do something after LOCKER-2 issued commit (and thus released record): we first have to ensure that this record
                 now is locked by WORKER. The same when record was occupied by LOCKER-2 and then is released: LOCKER-1 must not do smth until WORKER will
                 encounter this record and 'catch' it.
           This is done by calls to function 'wait_for_record_become_locked()' which are performed by separate 'monitoring' connection with starting Tx
           with NO_WAIT mode and catching exception with further parsing. In case when record has been already occupied (by WORKER) this exception will
           have form "deadlock / -update conflicts ... / -concurrent transaction number is <N>". We can then obtain number of this transaction and query
           mon$statements for get MON$SQL_TEXT that is runnig by this Tx. If it contains contains 'special tag' (see variable SQL_TAG_THAT_WE_WAITING_FOR)
           then we can be sure that WORKER really did establish connection and successfully locked row with required ID.

           Table 'TLOG_WANT' (which is fulfilled by trigger TEST_BIUD using in autonomous tx) can NOT be used for detection of moments when WORKER
           actually locks records which he was waiting for: this trigger fires BEFORE actual updating occurs, i.e. when record become seeon by WORKER
           but is still occupied by some LOCKER ("[DOC]: c) engine continue to evaluate remaining records ... and put write locks on it too")

           NB! Worker transaction must running in WAIT mode - in contrary to Tx that we start in our monitoring loop.

        Checked on WI-T6.0.0.55, WI-T5.0.0.1229, WI-V4.0.4.2995 (all SS/CS).
