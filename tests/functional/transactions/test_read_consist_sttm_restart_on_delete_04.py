#                   **********************************************
#               
#                   This test verifies that statement-level snapshot and restart will be performed when "main" session ("worker") 
#                   performs DELETE statement and is involved in update conflicts.
#                   ("When update conflict is detected <...> then engine <...> creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution...")
#               
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   This test uses script %FBT_REPO%
#               iles
#               ead-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
#                   Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
#                   results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
#                   outcome of test.
#               
#                   ###############
#                   Following scenario if executed here (see also: "doc\\README.read_consistency.md"; hereafer is marked as "DOC"):
#                   * five rows are inserted into the table TEST, with IDs: 1...5.
#               
#                   * session 'locker-1' ("BLOCKER" in Tom Kyte's article ):
#                         update test set id = id where id = 1
#               
#                   * session 'worker' ("LONG" in TK article) has mission:
#                         delete from test where id<=2 order by id DESC rows 4; // using TIL = read committed read consistency
#               
#                       // Execution will have PLAN ORDER <DESCENDING_INDEX>.
#                       // It will delete rows starting with ID = 2 but can not change row with ID = 1 because of locker-1.
#                       // Update conflict appears here and, because of this, worker temporary changes its TIL to RC no record_version (RC NRV).
#                       // [DOC]: "a) transaction isolation mode temporarily switched to the READ COMMITTED *NO RECORD VERSION MODE*"
#                       // This (new) TIL allows worker further to see all committed versions, regardless of its own snapshot.
#               
#                   * session 'locker-2' ("FIRSTLAST" in TK article): replaces ID = 5 with new value = -5, then commits
#                     and locks this record again:
#                         (1) commit;
#                         (2) update test set id = -5 where abs(id)=5;
#                         (3) commit;
#                         (4) update test set id = id where abs(id)=5;
#                      // session-'worker' remains waiting at this point because row with ID = 1 is still occupied by by locker-1.
#                      // but worker must further see record with (new) id = -5 because its TIL was changed to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.
#               
#               
#                   * session 'locker-1': replaces ID = 4 with new value = -4, then commits and locks this record again:
#                         (1) commit;
#                         (2) update test set id = -4 where abs(id)=4;
#                         (3) commit;
#                         (4) update test set id = id where abs(id)=4;
#               
#                     // This: '(1) commit' - will release record with ID = 1. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
#                     // [DOC]: "b) engine put write lock on conflicted record"
#                     // But it is only 2nd row of total 4 that worker must delete.
#                     // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
#                     // Worker resumes search for any rows with ID < 2, and it does this with taking in account required order
#                     // of its DML (i.e. 'ORDER BY ID DESC ...')
#                     // [DOC]: "c) engine continue to evaluate remaining records of update\\delete cursor and put write locks on it too"
#                     // Worker starts to search records which must be involved in its DML and *found* first sucn row with ID = -5.
#                     // NB. This row currently can NOT be deleted by worker because locker-2 has uncommitted update of it.
#                     // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.
#                     // :::!! NB, AGAIN !! ::: restart NOT occurs here because at least one records found, see:
#                     // [DOC]: "d) when there is *no more* records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions performed since

#                     //         e) then engine restores transaction isolation mode as READ COMMITTED *READ CONSISTENCY*,

#               
#                   * session 'locker-2': replaces ID = 3 with new value = -3, then commits and locks this record again:
#                         (1) commit;
#                         (2) update test set id = -3 where abs(id)=3;

#                     // But this is only 3rd row of total 4 that worker must delete.
#                     // Because of worker TIL = RC NRV, he must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
#                     // Worker resumes search for any rows with ID < -5, and it does this with taking in account required order

#                     // There are no such rows in the table.
#                     // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT NO RECORDS FOUND, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN MAKES FIRST STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART.
#                     // [DOC]: "d) when there is no more records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions ... and preserve already taken write locks

#                     //           creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."
#               
#                   * session 'locker-1':
#                         commit;
#                     // This will release record with ID=-4. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
#                     // At this point worker has proceeded all required number of rows for DML: 2, 1, -4 and -5.
#                     // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT ALL ROWS WERE PROCEEDED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN MAKES SECOND STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART.
#                     // [DOC]: "d) when there is no more records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions ... and preserve already taken write locks

#                     //            creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."
#                     // After this restart worker will waiting for row with ID = -3 (it sees this because of TIL = RC NRV).
#               
#                   * session 'locker-2':
#                       commit.
#                     // This releases row with ID=-3. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
#                     // Records with ID = 2, 1, -4 and -5 already have been locked, but worker must delete only FOUR rows (see its DML statement).
#                     // Thus only rows with ID = 2, 1, -3 and -4 will be deleted. Record with ID = -5 must *remain* in the table.
#                     // At this point worker has proceeded all required rows that meet condition for DML: 2, 1, -3 and -4.
#                     // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT ALL ROWS WERE PROCEEDED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN MAKES THIRD STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART.
#                     // [DOC]: "d) when there is no more records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions ... and preserve already taken write locks
#                     //         e) then engine restores transaction isolation mode as READ COMMITTED *READ CONSISTENCY*, 
#                     //            creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."
#               
#                   Expected result:
#                   * session-'worker' must *successfully* complete deletion of 4 rows (but only two of them did exist at the starting point).
#                     Record with ID = -5 must remain in the table.
#               
#                   * four unique values must be in the column TLOG_DONE.SNAP_NO for session-'worker' when it performed DELETE statement: first of them
#                     was created by initial statement start and all others reflect three restarts (this column has values which are evaluated using
#                     rdb$get_context('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER') -- see trigger TEST_AIUD).
#                     It is enough to count these values using COUNT(*) or enumarate them by DENSE_RANK() function.
#               
#                   NOTE: concrete values of fields TRN, GLOBAL_CN and SNAP_NO in the TLOG_DONE can differ from one to another run!
#                   This is because of concurrent nature of connections that work against database. We must not assume that these values will be constant.
