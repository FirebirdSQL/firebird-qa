#                   Note on terms which are used there: "BLOCKER", "LONG" and "FIRSTLAST" - their names are slightly changed here
#                   to: LOCKER-1, WORKER and LOCKER-2 respectively.

#                   **********************************************
#               
#                   This test verifies that statement-level snapshot and restart will be performed when "main" session ("worker") 
#                   performs UPDATE statement and is involved in update conflicts.
#                   ("When update conflict is detected <...> then engine <...> creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution...")
#               
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   This test uses script %FBT_REPO%
#               iles
#               ead-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
#                   Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
#                   results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
#                   outcome of test.
#               
#                   ###############
#                   Following scenario if executed here (see also: "doc\\README.read_consistency.md"; hereafer is marked as "DOC"):
#               
#                   * five rows are inserted into the table TEST, with IDs: 1,2,3,4,5
#                   * session 'locker-1' ("BLOCKER" in Tom Kyte's article ):
#                           delete from test where id = 5;
#               
#                   * session 'worker' ("LONG" in TK article) has mission:
#                           update test set id = -id where exists(select * from test where id < 0 or id = 5) order by id; // using TIL = read committed read consistency
#               
#                       // Execution will have PLAN ORDER <ASCENDING_INDEX>.
#                       // Worker starts with updating rows with ID = 1...4 but can not change row with ID = 5 because of locker-1.
#                       // Because of detecting update conflist, worker changes here its TIL to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.
#

#                       // Record with (new) id = -11 will be seen further because worker's TIL was changed to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.
#

#                       // Thus worker sees record with id = -11 (which is locked now by locker-2) and puts write-lock on it.

#                       // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.

#               
#                   * session 'locker-1':
#                           (1) commit;
#               
#                       // This removes record with id = -14.
#                       // At this point there are no more records to be locked (by worker) that meet cursor condition: worker did put
#                       // write locks on all rows that meet its cursor conditions.
#                       // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT NO MORE RECORDS FOUND TO BE LOCKED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN
#                       // MAKES FIRST STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART. This restart is also the last in this test.
#               
#               
#                   Expected result:
#                   * session-'worker' must update of only rows with ID = 1...4 (reverting sign of IDs value).
#               
#                   * Two unique values must be in the column TLOG_DONE.SNAP_NO for session-'worker' when it performed UPDATE statement: first of them
#                     was created by initial statement start and second reflects SINGLE restart (this column has values which are evaluated using
#                     rdb$get_context('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER') -- see trigger TEST_AIUD).
#                     It is enough to count these values using COUNT(*) or enumarate them by DENSE_RANK() function.
#               
#                   NOTE: concrete values of fields TRN, GLOBAL_CN and SNAP_NO in the TLOG_DONE can differ from one to another run!
#                   This is because of concurrent nature of connections that work against database. We must not assume that these values will be constant.
