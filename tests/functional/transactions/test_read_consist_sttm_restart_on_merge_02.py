#                   **********************************************
#               
#                   This test verifies that statement-level snapshot and restart will be performed when "main" session ("worker") 
#                   performs DELETE statement and is involved in update conflicts.
#                   ("When update conflict is detected <...> then engine <...> creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution...")
#               
#                   ::: NB :::
#                   This test uses script %FBT_REPO%
#               iles
#               ead-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
#                   Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
#                   results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
#                   outcome of test.
#               
#

#                   Following scenario if executed here (see also: "doc\\README.read_consistency.md"; hereafer is marked as "DOC"):
#               
#                   * five rows are inserted into the table TEST, with IDs: 1...5
#                   * session 'locker-1' ("BLOCKER" in Tom Kyte's article );
#                           update set id=id where id = 5;
#               
#                   * session 'worker' ("LONG" in TK article) has mission:
#                           merge into test t using(select * from test where id < 0 or id >= 3 order by id) s on t.id = s.id when matched then delete;
#                           // using TIL = read committed read consistency
#               
#                       // Execution will have PLAN ORDER <ASCENDING_INDEX>.
#                       // It will delete rows with ID = 3 and 4 but hang on row with ID = 5 because of locker-1;
#                       // Update conflict appears here and, because of this, worker temporary changes its TIL to RC no record_version (RC NRV).
#                       // [DOC]: "a) transaction isolation mode temporarily switched to the READ COMMITTED *NO RECORD VERSION MODE*"
#                       // This (new) TIL allows worker further to see all committed versions, regardless of its own snapshot.
#               
#                   * session 'locker-2' ("FIRSTLAST" in TK article):

#                       // Session-worker must still hang because row with ID = 5 is occupied by locker-1.

#                       // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT NO MORE RECORDS FOUND TO BE LOCKED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN
#                       // MAKES FIRST STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART. This restart is also the last in this test.
#               
#                   Expected result:
#                   * session-'worker' must *successfully* complete deletion of all rows with ID < 0 or ID >= 3. Rows with ID = 1 and 2 must remain.
#               
#                   * Two unique values must be in the column TLOG_DONE.SNAP_NO for session-'worker' when it performed DELETE statement: first of them
#                     was created by initial statement start and second reflect SINGLE restart (this column has values which are evaluated using
#                     rdb$get_context('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER') -- see trigger TEST_AIUD).
#                     It is enough to count these values using COUNT(*) or enumarate them by DENSE_RANK() function.
#               
#                   NOTE: concrete values of fields TRN, GLOBAL_CN and SNAP_NO in the TLOG_DONE can differ from one to another run!
#                   This is because of concurrent nature of connections that work against database. We must not assume that these values will be constant.
