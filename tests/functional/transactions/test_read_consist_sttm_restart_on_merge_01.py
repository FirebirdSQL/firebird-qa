TITLE:       READ CONSISTENCY. Check creation of new statement-level snapshot and restarting changed caused by MERGE. Test-01.
DESCRIPTION:
  Initial article for reading:
      https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:::::P11_QUESTION_ID:11504247549852
      Note on terms which are used there: "BLOCKER", "LONG" and "FIRSTLAST" - their names are slightly changed here
      to: LOCKER-1, WORKER and LOCKER-2 respectively.

      **********************************************

      This test verifies that statement-level snapshot and restart will be performed when "main" session ("worker")
      performs MERGE statement and is involved in update conflicts.
      ("When update conflict is detected <...> then engine <...> creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution...")

      ::: NB :::
      This test uses script %FBT_REPO%/files/read-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
      Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
      results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
      outcome of test.

      ###############
      Following scenario if executed here (see also: "doc/README.read_consistency.md"; hereafer is marked as "DOC"):

      * three rows are inserted into the table TEST, with ID = 1,2,3 (and X=1,2,3)
      * session 'locker-1' ("BLOCKER" in Tom Kyte's article ):
              update test set id = id where id = 3;

      * session 'worker' ("LONG" in TK article) has mission:
              merge into test t -- THIS MUST BE LOCKED
              using (select * from test order by id) s on s.id=t.id
              when matched then
                  update set t.id = -t.id, t.x = -s.x
              when not matched then
                  insert(id,x) values(s.id, -s.x - 500);
              -- and it does this within read committed read consistency.


          // Execution will have PLAN ORDER <ASCENDING_INDEX>.
          // Worker starts with updating rows with ID = 1, 2 but can not change row with ID = 3 because of locker-1.
          // Because of detecting update conflist, worker changes here its TIL to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.

      * session 'locker-2' ("FIRSTLAST" in TK article):
              (1) insert into test(id) values(-13);
              (2) commit;
              (3) update test set id=id where id = -13;
          // session-'worker' remains waiting at this point because row with ID = 3 is still occupied by by locker-1.
          // Record with (new) id = -13 will be seen further because worker's TIL was changed to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.

      * session 'locker-1':
              (1) commit;
              (2) insert into test(id) values(-12);
              (3) commit;
              (4) update test set id=id where id = -12;

          // This: '(1) commit' - will release record with ID = 3. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
          // [DOC]: "b) engine put write lock on conflicted record"
          // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
          // Worker resumes search for rows that must be updated with taking in account required order of its DML (i.e. 'ORDER BY ID').
          // [DOC]: "c) engine continue to evaluate remaining records of update/delete cursor and put write locks on it too"
          // New record which is involved in DML (and did not exist before) *will be found*, its ID = -13.
          // Worker stops on this record (with ID = -13) because id is occupied by locker-2.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.
          // [DOC]: "d) when there is *no more* records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions performed since
          //            top-level statement execution starts and preserve already taken write locks
          //         e) then engine restores transaction isolation mode as READ COMMITTED *READ CONSISTENCY*,
          //            creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."

      * session 'locker-2':
              commit;

          // This: 'commit' - will release record with ID = -13. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
          // [DOC]: "b) engine put write lock on conflicted record"
          // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
          // Worker resumes search for rows that must be updated with taking in account required order of its DML (i.e. 'ORDER BY ID').
          // [DOC]: "c) engine continue to evaluate remaining records of update/delete cursor and put write locks on it too"
          // New record which is involved in DML (and did not exist before) *will be found*, its ID = -12.
          // Worker stops on this record (with ID = -12) because id is occupied by locker-1.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.
          // [DOC]: "d) when there is *no more* records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions performed since
          //            top-level statement execution starts and preserve already taken write locks
          //         e) then engine restores transaction isolation mode as READ COMMITTED *READ CONSISTENCY*,
          //            creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."


      * session 'locker-1':
              commit;
          // This commit will release record with ID = -12. Worker sees this record and put write-lock on it.
          // At this point there are no more records to be locked (by worker) that meet cursor condition: worker did put
          // write locks on all rows that meet its cursor conditions.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT NO MORE RECORDS FOUND TO BE LOCKED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN
          // MAKES FIRST STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART. This restart is also the last in this test.


      Expected result:
      * session-'worker' must update of all rows with reverting signs of their IDs. Records which were inserted must have positive IDs.

      * Two unique values must be in the column TLOG_DONE.SNAP_NO for session-'worker' when it performed MERGE statement: first of them
        was created by initial statement start and second reflects SINGLE restart (this column has values which are evaluated using
        rdb$get_context('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER') -- see trigger TEST_AIUD).
        It is enough to count these values using COUNT(*) or enumarate them by DENSE_RANK() function.

      NOTE: concrete values of fields TRN, GLOBAL_CN and SNAP_NO in the TLOG_DONE can differ from one to another run!
      This is because of concurrent nature of connections that work against database. We must not assume that these values will be constant.

        1. Added trace launch and its parsing in order to get number of times when WORKER statement did restart.
           See commits:
           1) FB 4.x (23-JUN-2022, 4.0.2.2782): https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/95b8623adbf129d0730a50a18b4f1cf9976ac35c
           2) FB 5.x (27-JUN-2022, 5.0.0.555):  https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/f121cd4a6b40b1639f560c6c38a057c4e68bb3df

           Trace must contain several groups, each with similar lines:
               <timestamp> (<trace_memory_address>) EXECUTE_STATEMENT_RESTART
               {SQL_TO_BE_RESTARTED}
               Restarted <N> time(s)

        2. To prevent raises between concurrent transactions, it is necessary to ensure that code:
               * does not allow LOCKER-2 to start its work until WORKER session will establish connection and - moreover - will actually locks first record 
                 from the scope that is seen by the query that we want to be executed by worker.
               * does not allow LOCKER-1 to do something after LOCKER-2 issued commit (and thus released record): we first have to ensure that this record
                 now is locked by WORKER. The same when record was occupied by LOCKER-2 and then is released: LOCKER-1 must not do smth until WORKER will
                 encounter this record and 'catch' it.
           This is done by calls to function 'wait_for_record_become_locked()' which are performed by separate 'monitoring' connection with starting Tx
           with NO_WAIT mode and catching exception with further parsing. In case when record has been already occupied (by WORKER) this exception will
           have form "deadlock / -update conflicts ... / -concurrent transaction number is <N>". We can then obtain number of this transaction and query
           mon$statements for get MON$SQL_TEXT that is runnig by this Tx. If it contains contains 'special tag' (see variable SQL_TAG_THAT_WE_WAITING_FOR)
           then we can be sure that WORKER really did establish connection and successfully locked row with required ID.

           Table 'TLOG_WANT' (which is fulfilled by trigger TEST_BIUD using in autonomous tx) can NOT be used for detection of moments when WORKER
           actually locks records which he was waiting for: this trigger fires BEFORE actual updating occurs, i.e. when record become seeon by WORKER
           but is still occupied by some LOCKER ("[DOC]: c) engine continue to evaluate remaining records ... and put write locks on it too")

           NB! Worker transaction must running in WAIT mode - in contrary to Tx that we start in our monitoring loop.

        Checked on WI-T6.0.0.48, WI-T5.0.0.1211, WI-V4.0.4.2988.

    [25.11.2023] pzotov
    Writing code requires more care since 6.0.0.150: ISQL does not allow specifying duplicate delimiters without any statements between them (two semicolon, two carets etc).
    Merge expression defined in 'SQL_TO_BE_RESTARTED' must NOT end with semicolon!

    [20.11.2024] pzotov
    ::: ACHTUNG ::: ENGINE MUST NOT USE 'PLAN SORT' IN THE QUERY WHICH HAS TO BE RESTARTED IN THIS TEST!
    Number of statement restarts CAN BE GREATER than expected! This occurs if a table (which is handled) has no appropriate index or if optimizer decides to use
    external sort (e.g. 'PLAN SORT') instead of index navigation. This affects only FB 6.x and can be seen on snapshots since 14.11.2024, see:
    https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/26e64e9c08f635d55ac7a111469498b3f0c7fe81 ("Cost-based decision between ORDER and SORT plans (#8316)").
    This result was explained by Vlad (letter 19.11.2024 09:59): external sort forces engine to materialize cursor resultset. In such state, in turn, cursor can not
    see records which not fall to this cursor expression or did not exist when cursor started its job.
    Because of that, SQL_TO_BE_RESTARTED expression was changed: 'ROWS 10' was added after 'ORDER BY' clause to make optimizer choose 'PLAN ORDER' every time.
    Perhaps, this change is temporary solution.
