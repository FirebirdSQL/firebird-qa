Changelog

Version 0.15.1
==============

* Package `psutil` is now a dependency, installed automatically with plugin.
* Added `encryption` marker to mark test as requiring the encryption plugin

Version 0.15.0
==============

* To simplify portable use of databases with special configuration via `databases.conf`,
  the plugin initialization now ensures empty subdirectory `QA` in Firebird sample directory.
  To define your test databases in `databases.conf`, use next pattern::

    my_db = $(dir_sampleDB)/QA/my-db.fdb
    {
    ...
    }

  On plugin initialization, the `QA` sub-directory is first emptied and removed, and then
  newly created. On non-Windows, full privileges are granted.

* Added possibility to use databases aliases. The `.db_factory()` parameter `filename` is
  now handled as database alias if it starts with `#`, for example `#employee` means alias
  `employee`. The alias must be defined in `databases.conf` file.

  When filename is an alias, the `.Database.db_path` property does not contain
  full `~pathlib.Path` to the database, but this database alias.
